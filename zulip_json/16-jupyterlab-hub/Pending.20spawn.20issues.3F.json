The Casper login nodes don't look quite as busy today, but if you can't get on a login node I'd recommend trying a compute node instead.</p>\n<p>More detail than you probably want, but if you ssh to Casper you can run <code>$ qstat | grep jhublog</code> to see how busy the hub login nodes are (compute node requests go through the <code>htc</code> queue).

If someone here knows how to preserve this session state, I'd be very interested in learning about that.</p>",
