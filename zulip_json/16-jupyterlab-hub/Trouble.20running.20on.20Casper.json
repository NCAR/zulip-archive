I think in this case it was that the jupyterhub was oversubscribed and there are a limited number of sessions that can run simultaneously (using <code>qstat -Q</code> it looks like that number might be 108?). I did chat briefly with Rory Kelly about this and the time limit is long (7 days) since it's the same as a standard terminal session on a login node. So it's probably good if people remember to close out their jupyterhub sessions so others can get on during busy times <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>The <code>DAV_PROJECT</code> info is still helpful, since I should probably set that environment variable anyway. Taking a closer look at SAM, it appears that in the absence of this setting, the spawner on the login node selects from any of the project codes that I have access to, seemingly at random.</p>",

You are correct though that there was a cap hit on the number of Casper login sessions.
