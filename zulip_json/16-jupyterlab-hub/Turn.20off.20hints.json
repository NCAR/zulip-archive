I want to turn off the hints which have somehow recently appeared in my jupyter notebooks on jupyter hub.  They weren't there before and I find them really annoying.  I've pasted in a figure of the kind of thing I want to turn off below.  Does anyone know how to disable this feature?  Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/42/gWnmPmuTm4XCwYMAVEe47atI/Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-10-01-11.png\">Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-10-01-11.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/42/gWnmPmuTm4XCwYMAVEe47atI/Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-10-01-11.png\" title=\"Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-10-01-11.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/42/gWnmPmuTm4XCwYMAVEe47atI/Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-10-01-11.png\"></a></div>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks.  Yes, I found that and then found this... You can deactivate the kernel suggestions by adding \"Kernel\" to the disableCompletionsFrom in the completion section of Advanced Settings. Alternatively if you only want kernel completions you can add \"LSP\" to the same setting; Or add both if you like to code in hardcore mode and get no completions, or if another provider has been added.</p>\n<p>When I look in my settings it seems like I have both Kernel and LSP in the \"disableCompletionsFrom\", so what they suggest there doesn't seem to be helping me.  Below is what I have in my settings, so it looks like these are set to me.  Perhaps I will log out of jupyterhub and back in.  See if it takes effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/14/VuvmofF4gwm5gxHYKHrCCh8x/Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-16-24-48.png\">Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-16-24-48.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/14/VuvmofF4gwm5gxHYKHrCCh8x/Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-16-24-48.png\" title=\"Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-16-24-48.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/14/VuvmofF4gwm5gxHYKHrCCh8x/Screenshot-at-2022-05-12-16-24-48.png\"></a></div>",
