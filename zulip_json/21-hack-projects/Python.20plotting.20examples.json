Additionally, the GeoCAT team has a new hire, Michaela Sizemore,  starting next month that will also be developing example Python plotting scripts for geoscience data. If you would like to suggest NCL example plotting scripts as candidates for conversion, or have ideas on an entirely new plotting examples, please feel free to suggest these as GitHub issues here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/GeoCAT-examples/issues\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NCAR/GeoCAT-examples/issues\">https://github.com/NCAR/GeoCAT-examples/issues</a></p>\n<p>or simply post to this stream.</p>",
