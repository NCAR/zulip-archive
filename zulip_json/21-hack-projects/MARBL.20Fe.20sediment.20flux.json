I aim to finish this off to generate a dataset that we can use in our upcoming JRA integration (see <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"20\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/23-0.2E1.C2.B0-JRA-BGC-Run\">#0.1Â° JRA BGC Run</a>). Once that's done, it would be great to solicit some help from <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1\">@geocat</span>  and <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"4\">@xdev</span>. I think this is a reasonable motivating use case to support for re-gridding. It's POP specific, but I would like to make it model agnostic.</p>\n<p>@all, this repo might provide an example for project layout (see <a href=\"#narrow/stream/24-hack-projects/topic/project.20template.20repo\" title=\"#narrow/stream/24-hack-projects/topic/project.20template.20repo\">#hack-projects: project template repo</a>).</p>",

I am now using <code>papermill</code> to parameterize and run the notebooks in a workflow. This is useful because I can produce different versions of the dataset for different ocean grids, for instance, re-using the same code and documenting each step in the process. I am still ironing out little bugs in the elements of the workflow, but I hope to wrap this up on Friday.</p>",
