It seems like there's opportunities to use CF conventions for unit conversions, weighting by days per month, some logic on averaging stocks vs. summing fluxes, etc that could be pretty standardized.  Maybe this is already under way, and I'm not aware of all the tools that are available.</p>",

We hope to provide an online tutorial this summer to help teach interested people like you about the existing software stack so you can help us determine the tools that are missing or how existing tools are lacking. Please stay tuned!</p>",
