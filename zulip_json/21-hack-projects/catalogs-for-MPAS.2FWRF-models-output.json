The raw WRF outputs also have an enormous amount of junk metadata in them that we filter out.  And they need some cleanup to be fully CF-compliant.</p>",

It sounds like WRF and CESM are in the same boat. Having input on the state of MPAS model may help in deciding how to proceed.</p>",

Do you have any WRF netCDF files on glade that I can look at in order to see what kind of attributes they attach to the files and what the file structure looks like?  I'm hoping to come up with some kind of generic interface that can be used for all NCAR models.</p>",
