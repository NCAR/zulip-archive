        "content": "<p>Hi Dani, Just as a first check, were you running with the <code>--time-series</code> (or <code>-ts</code>) flag? If so, the timeseries generation should occur <em>before</em> running through any notebooks. For the time being, if you wanted to run timeseries for just one component, you could also update the list of components which timeseries are run for in <a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD/blob/bf65cdd79ad0c4e6b9a1396a4dee2465f9b3bc40/cupid/run.py#L54\"><code>run.py</code></a>. The notebooks shouldn't be executing until after that point (see <a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD/blob/bf65cdd79ad0c4e6b9a1396a4dee2465f9b3bc40/cupid/run.py#L75\">here</a>). One other note-- <a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD/pull/88\">Lev's PR</a> is going to be changing how we call notebooks (and possibly timeseries generation) for either all or a single component.</p>",

Dani, could you DM me your version of the config.yml file whenever you get around to it?</p>",
