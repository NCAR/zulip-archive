However, when I do the plot, it remembers the time axis from the dataframe. So, it plots the values versus real years (1979 -) I want to reset years to 0 to 40 say. I have tried reset_index() and this appeared to do what I wanted, but I still got a plot versus the real years. I also tried to_numpy(). Same thing.
