The main one is to switch the latitude-pressure (or longitude-pressure) plots to use a log-pressure scale. I think we currently control this in the variable defaults yaml file with a flag. The other thing would be to adapt contour levels to be appropriate if plotting quantities at pressure levels above the troposphere. That's also controlled on a per-variable basis in the variable defaults file.</p>",
