This is my first time using the NCAR/UCAR Jupyter via Cheyenne, and it is not able to recognize matplot imports or windrose imports in notebooks that I have uploaded. How can I get it to recognize those? In a local distribution using Anaconda I am able to install any missing packages on its command prompt, but I am not sure if as a Student I have access to command prompt install privileges, as well as where I could even go to install those (There is a terminal usually within Jupyter itself but you typically need permissions to install via there). If anyone has some pointers on how to install python packages on the Cheyenne Jupyter interface, it'd be very useful! Thanks!</p>",
