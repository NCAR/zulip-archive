When I go to File &gt; Open from path..., I keep getting that the path couldn't be found, even though it exists and I have read/write permissions (I've tried both absolute (/glade/...) and relative path names). Any ideas on why this might be? Is there a way to open notebooks that aren't in our home directories? thanks!</p>",
