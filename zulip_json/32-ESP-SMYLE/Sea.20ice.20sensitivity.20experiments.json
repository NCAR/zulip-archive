However, in this simulation, S is also restored to observed climatology, so I think we can avoid Tfrz messed up (Could <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"115\">@Marika Holland</span> chime in to confirm if my interpretation is right?). We can also restore T to max(Tfrz,Trst), but the caveat is that it is less effective than restoring just to Tfrz. Assuming my interpretation is right, I think (1) or (1) with some further tuning is the most viable option because it has the edge in the Souther Ocean...</p>",

Your new sensitivities show that it doesn't do much, the SST restoring to Tfrz(S) is what is important. If we eliminate SSS restoring, then I think Marika's worry is eliminated because enhanced summer melting will increase Tfrz, but the model will be restored to that new higher Tfrz (with a weighting by ice fraction).</p>",

This then impacts the amount of summer melting and the resulting September ice concentration. If we restore to Tfrz throughout the simulations, then the restoring flux will be larger later in the record when thin/low concentration ice is present and this can affect the time evolution of the simulation in non-physical ways. Because of this, I think that adjustments to the forcing (the LW down and/or air temperature) may be \"safer\".</p>",

The dt_mlt defines the temperature below freezing at which the snow transitions to wet snow values (with lower albedos). The R_snw=1.6 is actually equivalent to R_snw=1.75 (as in LENS) because we have a minimum snow grain radius value and the model reaches that for an R_snw value of 1.6.

As Marika said, she is concerned about the variability in the sea ice with the restoring. So, it would be good to assess the 2010 state in the runs. This is also the initial state we need for the prediction runs right? In terms of the default configuration for G compsets moving forward, we need to do more of a detailed assessment and that should be a longer term goal. We are fine with the albedo changes, but it would be good to assess the forcing changes against observations and also assess variability with the restoring.

So, the reduced winter sea ice concentration around the ice edge might be related to stronger heat transport.  I suspect that the restoring under sea ice is responsible for this AMOC increase.

The reduced bias with the restoring might enhances deep water formation. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/20/qv9QUXa357SHRmZ9WcF27lY7/amoc_indx_ts_final.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"amoc_indx_ts_final.png\">amoc_indx_ts_final.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/20/qv9QUXa357SHRmZ9WcF27lY7/amoc_indx_ts_final.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"amoc_indx_ts_final.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/20/qv9QUXa357SHRmZ9WcF27lY7/amoc_indx_ts_final.png\"></a></div>",

The default used in our CMIP6 CESM2 simulations; tuned albedos used in CESM2(CAM6) simulations; and the ones used for our CESM2(FOSI) case. As discussed, we will perform some sensitivity simulations for the actual prediction simulations. However, if we decide to go with the second, i.e., the tuned albedos, for these CESM2(CAM6) simulations, if we ever perform prediction simulations with the high-top model version to evaluate prediction sensitivity to model top, that is, CESM2(WACCM6), what albedos will we use? My worry is that we are opening the door to changes potentially in other component models as well with the thinking that we are after the \"best possible solutions\" in each configuration. This takes me back to the discussions that we had in late 1990s and early 2000s as to what we should do.</p>",
