I would guess that the relatively rapidly growing perturbation errors in the atmosphere would take over for generating spread soon in many parts of the ocean after initializing. (Maybe different ocean ICs would contribute to the growth of atmospheric spread.) So a goal might be to make sure that regions that may be more insulated from atmospheric influence, e.g. at greater ocean depths, also have a chance to develop spread. If so is it a question of what kinds of perturbations might project onto whatever growing modes might exist? Maybe that's an argument for the lagged ensemble, as those length scales would presumably be present, whereas high wavenumber, pertlim-like perturbations could just get damped out?</p>",

It looks like the OCEAN5 reanalysis that Steve pointed to generates spread by perturbing the location of ocean observations in a DA procedure, which is designed to sample over and account for observational representativeness error (<a href=\"https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/17831-generic-ensemble-generation-scheme-data-assimilation-and-ocean-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/17831-generic-ensemble-generation-scheme-data-assimilation-and-ocean-analysis\">https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/17831-generic-ensemble-generation-scheme-data-assimilation-and-ocean-analysis</a>) in addition to the uncertainty in the DA posterior.  Lang et al. (2012) outline strategies used at ECMWF, including work on singular vectors by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119\">@Joe Tribbia</span>  and SKEB by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"48\">@Judith Berner</span>  et al.

One way to do this that would try to keep the perturbations on the model attractor could be to compute Kalman increments based on misfits between FOSI and observations (or a data product, like Roemmich and Gilson). We'd have to have a time period to compute those statistics that didn't overlap with the prediction interval.</p>",
