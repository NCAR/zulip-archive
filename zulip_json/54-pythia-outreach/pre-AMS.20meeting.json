We can have it be one or two sessions and give people a brief overview of potential topics and projects to tackle. Separately, as that time has been booked as Unidata's holiday party while some of our remote staff travel in for AMS, I will likely not be able to attend synchronously in-person (though can help support topics/projects and planning later next week.)</p>",
