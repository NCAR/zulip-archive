Any idea what's going on?

I have also looked through the GeoCat webpage and googled in general and not found a clear solution. I am hoping I am just missing something minor. But this github quiver issue (<a href=\"https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/issues/1179\">https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/issues/1179</a>) makes me concerned that there wasn't actually an existing solution for the vectors. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"134\">@Max Grover</span> do you have any suggestions?

You have to do a fairly simple rotation from the CICE grid to the \"real\" map. There are a few keys that I think can be posted somewhere (blog post, geocat example, etc.) and probably something that could be added to pop_tools. </p>\n<p>1) You need to have the ANGLE value from the pop grid. This is not currently in the grid from pop_tools, but could be added.<br>\n2) Then you rotate the raw u and v vectors using the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>u_rot = (u_raw*np.cos(angle)) - (v_raw*np.sin(angle))\nv_rot = (u_raw*np.sin(angle)) + (v_raw*np.cos(angle))\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>That's it. Pretty simple, but it took a while to sort out. See below for the comparison of rotated and non-rotated vectors. I also wrote it up simply in the following notebook that might be useful as well. <br>\n/glade/p/cgd/ppc/duvivier/cesm2_arctic_cyclones/rufmod_analysis/version_2/ice_transport/vector_tests/testing3.ipynb<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6b/a8_DZ9_MYvzhD0K1WcC0Ozm5/Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-4.07.50-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-4.07.50-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6b/a8_DZ9_MYvzhD0K1WcC0Ozm5/Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-4.07.50-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-4.07.50-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/6b/a8_DZ9_MYvzhD0K1WcC0Ozm5/Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-4.07.50-PM.png\"></a></div>",
