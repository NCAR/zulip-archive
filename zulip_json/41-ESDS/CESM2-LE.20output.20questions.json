I want to compare two decades of several (ocean, monthly) variables available in CESM2-LE and am struggling with enormous file sizes and processing times using Jupyter notebooks. Is there someone who has worked or is working with analyzing output from 100 ensemble members that can share tips to make my experiments more efficient? I can send a path to one notebook for you to peruse, if that helps. Thanks in advance!</p>",
