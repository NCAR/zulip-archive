It includes an overview of the Python programming language as needed for data science using variables, data structures, loops, conditional statements (old and new), and object-oriented methods (functions and classes). With this foundation we will explore open data, how to obtain it, how to explore, change, manipulate and visual it. This series is for people new to Python as well as seasoned veterans looking for the newer/better methods of using Python for data science. Sign up for each session in the series individually on <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/events#all_events-89\">our events page</a>.</p>\n<p>September Events</p>\n<p>·       9/05 – CRDDS Fall Open House<br>\n·       9/06 – Publish, not Perish: Demystifying the Submission and Review Process<br>\n·         9/19 – Historical Database Construction with Dr. Anne Ruderman, London School of Economics<br>\n·         9/19 – Fundamentals of Python for Data Science: Week 1<br>\n·         9/20 – Publish, not Perish: Knowing Your Rights as an Academic Author<br>\n·         9/20 – Introduction to Git &amp; GitHub</p>",
