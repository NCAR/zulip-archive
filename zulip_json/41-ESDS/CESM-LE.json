One comes from the last history file of the historical, and the other from the first history file of the SSP. </p>\n<p>When I inspected them, the JAN1 from the historical looks good, but the JAN1 from the SSP looks like an initialization step, and not  like valid daily output. We're planning to drop that second JAN1. Does this sound reasonable?
