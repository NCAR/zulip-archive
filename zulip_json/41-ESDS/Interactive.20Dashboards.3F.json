You are also welcome to join us at the 08 April ESDS Committee Meeting (let me know if you need meeting details). Nick, looking forward to the discussion next Monday! I think a dashboard forum talk and possibly a workshop would be a great idea. Thanks for facilitating <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"19\">@John Clyne</span></p>",
