It also contains a number of<br>\nstatistical and visual tools for gathering metrics and comparing Earth<br>\nSystem Model data files.  The use case that is motivating this work is comparing<br>\na CESM file with lossy compressed variants of the file.</p>\n<p>Currently LDCPy supports CAM-FV and POP data (time series files).  We<br>\nare still <em>actively developing</em> the package (adding features and compatibility<br>\nwith other module data), and would be happy to receive any comments,<br>\nfeedback, or suggestions on how we can make it more useful to the community.  Also feel<br>\nfree to report bugs :). As a final note, we have a number of sample notebooks available and have also set up a Pangeo<br>\nbinder.</p>",

Max Grover will be sending regular reminders for signups. Furthermore, we encourage proposals for mini-tutorial topics to intersperse with the WIP talks. Ask questions via Zulip or emailâ€”for example, \"how do I compute EOFs in Python?\" and we can identify people to present an overview of the answer in the WIP meeting.</p>\n<p>As discussed in this week's meeting, xDev will be holding office hours 3-5p on Mondays via this Gather here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://gather.town/i/qvE3R7yq\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gather.town/i/qvE3R7yq\">https://gather.town/i/qvE3R7yq</a></p>\n<p>We will retain the alternate week meeting slot for other ESDS topics and smaller focus groups. There will be no WIP talk next week, but a small group will meet to discuss a roadmap for ESDS. Please let me know if you are interested in joining this group; we do not mean to be exclusive, but also acknowledge challenges to in-depth conversation with large groups.</p>\n<p>Since 5 July is a holiday, WIP talks will resume 12 July and we'll commence the alternating schedule from there.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend!</p>",
