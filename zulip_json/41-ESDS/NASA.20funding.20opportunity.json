This includes events that<br>\nsupport the vision of enabling transformation open science through the continuous<br>\nevolution of science data and computing as outlined in SMD's Strategy for Data<br>\nManagement and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024. The goals of the<br>\nOSSI include development and implementation of capabilities to enable open science,<br>\ncontinuous evolution of data and computer systems, and harnessing the scientific<br>\ncommunity and strategic partnerships for innovation. Events designed to expand the<br>\nopen science capabilities of the SMD scientific community are welcome including:<br>\n• Events focused on SMD data, software, or open science practices<br>\n• Hackathons, un-conferences, and challenges that build open science skills<br>\n• Training in open science<br>\nProposals that include training should align to and address the Transform to Open<br>\nScience (TOPS) initiative. In addition to relevance to OSSI, the proposal must also<br>\ninclude how the material produced as part of the event will be made openly available<br>\nand plans for inclusive participation in the event.</p>\n</blockquote>",
