There are several possible ways to do this, but here are just two examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>pip install -e $LOCALDIR/pop-tools</code>, and try to develop directly in <code>pop-tools</code> PRO: when my feature is ready, it's already in the right place to submit a PR to add it to <code>pop-tools</code>; CON: it might takes weeks or months for the full process (develop feature, go through review process, have PR merged, get new release) during which time I'm stuck using an older version of <code>pop-tools</code>; also, it's a lot to ask of users who aren't familiar with the development process for the tool they want to improve</li>\n<li>In the high-res repo, create a <code>pop_tools_future</code> directory and develop directly there. Then, when the feature is complete, start the review / PR / release process in a separate sandbox. PRO: once feature is available in <code>pop-tools</code>, it's just a change from <code>pop_tools_future</code> to <code>pop_tools</code> in your call (and maybe commenting out the <code>import pop_tools_future</code> line). CON: it's pretty kludgy during the development stage; if the new feature depends on other (existing) <code>pop-tools</code> features it might not be as easy as copying directly into the <code>pop-tools</code> sandbox</li>\n</ol>",

At first, I wholeheartedly agreed with you, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"25\">@Deepak Cherian</span>.  This is anathema to agile developers and advocates of the continuous delivery (CD) paradigm.  </p>\n<p>However, after thinking about it a bit, I think there is a difference between the \"scientist first, then developer\" mode of work and the \"developer first, then scientist\" mode of work.  With the former I think the priority is the scientific result, and with the later the priority is the published software feature.  Unfortunately, the two priorities do not always align perfectly.  Prioritizing the scientific result can sometimes require pushing on many simultaneous features at once, leading to a new scientific result but not \"ready for release\" software features.  This is what I think <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"10\">@Michael Levy</span> was implying.  On the other hand, prioritizing the development usually means pushing on individual features <em>one at a time</em> (in sequence, if working alone, or in parallel, if working as a team) and continually releasing along the way, but this can lead to significant delays in achieving the scientific result while you wait for all the required pieces to be put in place.  </p>\n<p>I'm not sure there is a \"fix\" to this.  In the early days of discussion on ESDS (before ESDS was a \"thing\"), <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"14\">@Matt Long</span> and I talked about \"scientists first\" folks pushing toward the scientific result while \"developers first\" folks simultaneously focused on cleaning up, finishing, and releasing the proto-features that the scientists developed.  But I've come to see that this approach tends to be very inefficient and doesn't work well in practice.</p>",
