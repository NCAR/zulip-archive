Could you help me help them develop the best product for our user base by telling me your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>favorite features from the JupyterHub on Cheyenne and Casper</li>\n<li>any example workflows that show data access, worker distribution, analysis, plotting (any steps I didn't touch?)</li>\n<li>and of course your headaches that you've encountered (making sure your session has ended, difficulty managing environments, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for your help! I will take your responses and discuss them with the team on Friday.</p>",
