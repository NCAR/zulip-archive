All machine learning techniques are welcome, from kernel methods to deep learning. Each submission should clearly illustrate why the application has (or could have) a pathway to impact regarding climate change. We highly encourage submissions that make their data publicly available. <br>\nSubmissions are non-archival, and do not preclude future publication.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage authors to consider applying for our mentorship program (applications due April 28th), which will pair authors with mentors having complementary expertise. Applications to participate as a mentor are also open; we invite those from academia, industry, government, and beyond to apply. Please see the workshop website for application instructions and more details on the program. </p>\n<p>Organizers:<br>\nHari Prasanna Das (UC Berkeley)<br>\nKasia Tokarska (ETH Zurich)<br>\nMaria Jo√£o Sousa (IST, ULisboa)<br>\nMeareg Hailemariam (DAUST)<br>\nDavid Rolnick (Mila, McGill)<br>\nXiaoxiang Zhu (TU Munich)<br>\nYoshua Bengio (Mila, UdeM)</p>",
