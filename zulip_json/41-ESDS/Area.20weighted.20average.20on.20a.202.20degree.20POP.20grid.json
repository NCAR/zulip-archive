I was using this as a guide:  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bradyrx/aee079f8494b084a5c56f7eaf83c8cef\">https://gist.github.com/bradyrx/aee079f8494b084a5c56f7eaf83c8cef</a></p>\n<p>The trouble is that areacello is not a field in my file (created by timeseries conversion from POP history files). The only comparable field I have is UAREA, but I would presumably want TAREA since TEMP is on the TGRID, right?</p>\n<p>What is the best way to go about this? Is there another file I can grab areacello from? Or another method I should use?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
