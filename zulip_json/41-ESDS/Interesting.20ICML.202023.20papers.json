Since we expect current dynamics to be smooth but highly non-linear, Gaussian processes (GPs) offer an attractive model. But we show that applying a GP with a standard stationary kernel directly to buoy data can struggle at both current prediction and divergence identification -- due to some physically unrealistic prior assumptions. To better reflect known physical properties of currents, we propose to instead put a standard stationary kernel on the divergence and curl-free components of a vector field obtained through a Helmholtz decomposition. We show that, because this decomposition relates to the original vector field just via mixed partial derivatives, we can still perform inference given the original data with only a small constant multiple of additional computational expense. We illustrate the benefits of our method on synthetic and real oceans data.</p>\n</blockquote>",

However, when trained in a purely offline mode, integrating ML models into the numerical scheme can lead to instabilities. In the context of a 2D, quasi-geostrophic turbulent system, we demonstrate that including an additional network in the loss function, which emulates the state of the system into the future, produces offline-trained ML models that capture important subgrid processes, with improved stability properties.</p>\n</blockquote>",
