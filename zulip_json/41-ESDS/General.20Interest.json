How can you collaborate with others on it, publish a specific version of it, archive a snapshot of the project for posterity, or deploy a live running server with your code?</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, you need not just an environment but also a project: a Conda environment coupled closely with a set of commands that can execute in that environment.

For those who haven't interacted with the gallery yet, we are implementing each plotting example separately in a Python script, which is also auto-generated to a Jupyter notebook. That said, instead of generating a single notebook for the whole NCL examples list (i.e. bootstrapping in this case), I think we would create separate scripts for each of those plots when it comes to include them in our gallery.</p>\n<p>For your reference, I have created this <a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/GeoCAT-examples/issues/353\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NCAR/GeoCAT-examples/issues/353\">GeoCAT-examples issue #353</a> to follow with this.</p>\n<p>cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"114\">@Anissa Zacharias</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"105\">@Michaela Sizemore</span></p>",
