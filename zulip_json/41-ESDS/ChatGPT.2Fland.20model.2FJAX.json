We'll be remotely hosting Anthony Zhou, an undergraduate with LEAP who worked on a project this summer that looked at using ChatGPT to convert code in the land model's photosynthesis module to Python + JAX.  The main questions he was examining were, a) is this useful, and b) how much easier is it when using these kinds of AI tools?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The details are below; feel free to share with others who might be interested.  Additionally, these 'guest talks' are something we're aiming to do every month or so; if you wish to be included to them regularly, just let me know and I'll create a 'cseg-guest-talks' alias for that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>CSEG Meeting - Guest Talk: Anthony Zhou<br>\nTuesday, August 22 · 2:00 – 2:45pm<br>\nTime zone: America/Denver<br>\nGoogle Meet joining info<br>\nVideo call link: <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/zyg-pczr-dpe\">https://meet.google.com/zyg-pczr-dpe</a><br>\nOr dial: ‪(US) +1 513-818-0859‬ PIN: ‪642 180 020‬#<br>\nMore phone numbers: <a href=\"https://tel.meet/zyg-pczr-dpe?pin=1803796626803\">https://tel.meet/zyg-pczr-dpe?pin=1803796626803</a></p>",
