I can already think of a few aspects I would personally like to see (e.g. meta-data conserving, able to scale in parallel but still runnable in serial).  My fear is that otherwise we'll get ~80% of the way done before realizing there is some major requirement we forgot about that won't be easily implementable in the routine as written.  I can start an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/cesm-hist2tseries\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NCAR/cesm-hist2tseries\">https://github.com/NCAR/cesm-hist2tseries</a> to get that conversation going if that is preferred.  </p>\n<p>Also, although I am happy to contribute to any design discussion, I sadly will be MIA coding-wise until about mid-May, as all of the AMP engineers have been explicitly directed to work on implementing new infrastructure in CAM/SIMA.  So if you want to exclude me from this particular sprint that is totally fine.  However, once this SIMA project is done I should be able to actually contribute coding help to whatever we collectively want to focus on then.  Thanks!</p>",

A couple issues that I would like to point out would be that the code relies on mpi4py which <em>can</em> be difficult to port.  Another issue is that the code is slow converting high frequency output and you'll have to be careful about how you parallelize over the problem or a dask implementation could run into the same issue.  The bottleneck is writing out the file in netcdf and there's not a great option to do this in parallel unless you're writing out in zarr.  And my 2 cents ... if at all possible, this operation should really be done by PIO coming out of the model.  Ignoring legacy runs or developement runs that turn into production runs, this operation creates duplicate data when disk space is already at a premium and this operation is hard to do without an email to cisl asking for more disk space.  You might also want to talk to Gary Strand for his advice on how this should be developed, especially because this task usually falls onto his to-do list.</p>",
