Most ecological models do not predict nitrogen fixation in the Antarctic Ocean because of the low availability of iron and high abundance of nitrogen. Here we extensively examined nitrogen fixation in the Antarctic Ocean, and found substantial nitrogen fixation (maximum: 44.4 nmol N l−1 d−1) near the Antarctic coast, especially around ice-covered regions. The nitrogenase gene (nifH) was detected at all coastal stations, including stations where no nitrogen fixation was found. At the stations where nitrogen fixation was detected, the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium UCYN-A (Candidatus ‘Atelocyanobacterium thalassa’) dominated nifH gene expression, and the nifH sequence was identical to that of the major oligotype in tropical and subtropical oceans. Our results suggest that marine nitrogen fixation is a ubiquitous process in the global ocean, and that UCYN-A is the keystone species for making it possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-00651-7\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-00651-7\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-00651-7</a></p>",

These photosynthetic organisms comprise more than 4300 marine species, but their biogeographic patterns and the resulting species diversity are poorly known, mostly owing to severe data limitations. Here, we compile, synthesize, and harmonize marine phytoplankton occurrence records from the two largest biological occurrence archives (Ocean Biogeographic Information System, OBIS; and Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF) and three independent recent data collections. We bring together over 1.36 million phytoplankton occurrence records (1.28 million at the level of species) for a total of 1704 species, spanning the principal groups of the diatoms, dinoflagellates, and haptophytes, as well as several other groups. This data compilation increases the amount of marine phytoplankton records available through the single largest contributing archive (OBIS) by 65 %. Data span all ocean basins, latitudes, and most seasons. Analyzing the oceanic inventory of sampled phytoplankton species richness at the broadest spatial scales possible using a resampling procedure, we find that richness tends to saturate at ∼93 % of all species in our database in the pantropics, at ∼64 % in temperate waters, and at ∼35 % in the cold Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere remains under-explored. We provide metadata on the cruise, research institution, depth, and date for each data record, and we include phytoplankton cell counts for 193 763 records. We strongly recommend consideration of spatiotemporal biases in sampling intensity and varying taxonomic sampling scopes between research cruises or institutions when analyzing the occurrence data spatially. Including such information into predictive tools, such as statistical species distribution models, may serve to project the diversity, niches, and distribution of species in the contemporary and future ocean, opening the door for quantitative macroecological analyses of phytoplankton.

Yet, fisheries have extracted a massive amount of this  “blue  carbon,”  contributing  to  additional  atmospheric  CO2  emissions.  Here,  we  used  historical  catches  and  fuel consumption to show that ocean fisheries have released a minimum of 0.73 billion metric tons of CO2 (GtCO2) in the atmosphere since 1950. Globally, 43.5% of the blue carbon extracted by fisheries in the high seas comes from areas that would be economically unprofitable without subsidies. Limiting blue carbon extraction by fisheries, particularly on unprofitable areas, would reduce CO2 emissions by burning less fuel and reactivating a natural carbon pump through the rebuilding of fish stocks and the increase of carcasses deadfall.<br>\n<a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/44/eabb4848.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/44/eabb4848.full.pdf\">https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/44/eabb4848.full.pdf</a></p>",

Here we evaluate whether the geographical range boundaries of species coincide with ecophysiological limits to acquisition of aerobic energy4 for a global cross-section of the biodiversity of marine animals. We observe a tight correlation between the metabolic rate and the efficacy<br>\nof oxygen supply, and between the temperature sensitivities of these traits, which suggests that marine animals are under strong selection for the tolerance of low O2 (hypoxia)5. The breadth of the resulting physiological tolerances of marine animals predicts a variety of geographical niches—from the tropics to high latitudes and from shallow to deep water—which better align with species distributions than do models based on either temperature or oxygen alone. For all studied species, thermal and hypoxic limits are substantially reduced by the energetic demands of ecological activity, a trait that varies similarly among marine and terrestrial taxa. Active temperature-dependent hypoxia thus links the biogeography of diverse marine species to fundamental energetic requirements that are shared across the animal kingdom.<br>\n<a href=\"http://url\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://url\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2721-y</a></p>",

This is especially the case for bottom‐associated (demersal) zooplankton that reside in the typically turbulent near‐bottom environment. Using moored sensors deployed at two coastal sites in the North Pacific and the Red Sea, we present observations of the effects of turbulence on the nocturnal emergence of demersal zooplankton. A cabled observatory consisting of a plankton camera, an acoustic current profiler and environmental sensors, was deployed near bottom in 20 m of water near Oshima Island, Japan. Observations were also obtained from a second site near a coral reef in 16 m of water in the Red Sea. Acoustic backscatter data obtained from current profilers at both sites provided a proxy for zooplankton density. Combined with simultaneous estimates of turbulence intensity, the observations suggest that the nocturnal emergence of demersal zooplankton was hindered by elevated levels of turbulence. While our findings are inferred from acoustic data, agreement between the two different sites supports our hypothesis that demersal zooplankton may remain near the bed during times of strong turbulence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11646\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11646\">https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11646</a></p>",

It is difficult to accurately gauge the magnitude of their current or historic ecosystem role without measuring feeding rates and prey consumed. To date, prey consumption of the largest species has been estimated using metabolic models3,4,5,6,7,8,9 based on extrapolations that lack empirical validation. Here, we used tags deployed on seven baleen whale (Mysticeti) species (n = 321 tag deployments) in conjunction with acoustic measurements of prey density to calculate prey consumption at daily to annual scales from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Our results suggest that previous studies3,4,5,6,7,8,9 have underestimated baleen whale prey consumption by threefold or more in some ecosystems. In the Southern Ocean alone, we calculate that pre-whaling populations of mysticetes annually consumed 430 million tonnes of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), twice the current estimated total biomass of E. superba10, and more than twice the global catch of marine fisheries today11. Larger whale populations may have supported higher productivity in large marine regions through enhanced nutrient recycling: our findings suggest mysticetes recycled 1.2 × 104 tonnes iron yr−1 in the Southern Ocean before whaling compared to 1.2 × 103 tonnes iron yr−1 recycled by whales today. The recovery of baleen whales and their nutrient recycling services2,3,7 could augment productivity and restore ecosystem function lost during 20th century whaling12,13.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03991-5\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03991-5</a></p>",

To address this challenge, we have updated and improved ECCO-Darwin, a global ocean biogeochemistry model that assimilates both physical and biogeochemical observations. The model consists of an adjoint-based ocean circulation estimate from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium and an ecosystem model developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Darwin Project. In addition to the data-constrained ECCO physics, a Green's function approach is used to optimize the biogeochemistry by adjusting initial conditions and six biogeochemical parameters. Over seasonal to multidecadal timescales (1995–2017), ECCO-Darwin exhibits broad-scale consistency with observed surface ocean pCO2 and air-sea CO2 flux reconstructions in most biomes, particularly in the subtropical and equatorial regions. The largest differences between CO2 uptake occur in subpolar seasonally stratified biomes, where ECCO-Darwin results in stronger winter uptake. Compared to the Global Carbon Project OBMs, ECCO-Darwin has a time-mean global ocean CO2 sink (2.47 ± 0.50 Pg C year−1) and interannual variability that are more consistent with interpolation-based products. Compared to interpolation-based methods, ECCO-Darwin is less sensitive to sparse and irregularly sampled observations. Thus, ECCO-Darwin provides a basis for identifying and predicting the consequences of natural and anthropogenic perturbations to the ocean carbon cycle, as well as the climate-related sensitivity of marine ecosystems. Our study further highlights the importance of physically consistent, property-conserving reconstructions, as are provided by ECCO, for ocean biogeochemistry studies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019MS001888\">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019MS001888</a></p>",

However, decadal regional ocean climate and fish stock predictions have until now had low forecast skill. Here, we provide skilful forecasts of the biomass of cod stocks in the North and Barents Seas a decade in advance. We develop a unified dynamical-statistical prediction system wherein statistical models link future stock biomass to dynamical predictions of sea surface temperature, while also considering different fishing mortalities. Our retrospective forecasts provide estimates of past performance of our models and they suggest differences in the source of prediction skill between the two cod stocks. We forecast the continuation of unfavorable oceanic conditions for the North Sea cod in the coming decade, which would inhibit its recovery at present fishing levels, and a decrease in Northeast Arctic cod stock compared to the recent high levels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00207-6\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00207-6</a></p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Strong Habitat Compression by Extreme Shoaling Events of Hypoxic Waters in the Eastern Pacific</strong><br>\nOcean deoxygenation has led to a measurable shoaling of subsurface hypoxic waters ([O2]  &lt; 60 mmol m−3) in the tropical Pacific and elsewhere. This shoaling compresses the vertical habitat of heterotrophic organisms between the well oxygenated surface and the hypoxic interface. Superimposed on this long-term trend, natural variability can cause shorter-term, extreme habitat compression events, which we term Transient Habitat Reduction Extreme Events (THREEs). Here, we investigate THREEs in the Eastern Pacific (EP) between 1979 and 2016 using output from a high-resolution hindcast simulation with the coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model ROMS-BEC. We identify THREEs on the basis of the hypoxic interface being shallower than the 99th percentile of its variability and requiring a minimum duration of 5 days. We find that THREEs compress the aerobic habitat by up to 50-70% (locally exceeding 80%) in the subtropical and tropical EP and reach horizontal scales exceeding 300 km in the tropical EP. There, THREEs are pre-conditioned by La Nin ̃a conditions and occur primarily in boreal winter and spring. In the subtropical EP, THREEs are associated with mesoscale eddies and occur independently of the season. 71% (32%) of all THREEs are characterized by unusually high acidity (cold) conditions (i.e., below the 1st percentile), thus constituting compound events. The strong habitat compression during THREEs is bound to lead to substantial changes in water column biogeochemistry, in food-web interactions, and in ecosystem structure. Yet, so far, very little is known about the impact of these transient phenomena.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022JC018429\">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022JC018429</a></p>",
