However, when I try to use </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>conda update seaborn\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>it tells me that I have the latest release already, but the version I have is 0.11.2. I then tried to conda remove the package, and then reinstall it using conda install, and it again downloaded the 0.11.2 version. I'm not sure why this is the case. I'm not sure if this is an issue with my environment or something to do with limits on Casper? Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!</p>",

In case anyone else has the same issue, you have to uninstall <em>both</em> seaborn and seaborn-base before installing the new seaborn package. In our case, we also specified the version number in the install command: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>conda install seaborn=0.13.2\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Thank you, Katelyn!</p>",
