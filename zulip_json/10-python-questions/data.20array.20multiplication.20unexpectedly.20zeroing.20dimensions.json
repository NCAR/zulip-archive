If you were to multiply to columns with each dimension depth:15, but one of them would have coordinates [1m, 2m, 3m..] and  the other [1.5m, 2.5m, 3.5m] it would not multiply them.</p>",

I thought the dimensions were identical, but they in fact were not. Setting them equal fixed the problem!</p>",
