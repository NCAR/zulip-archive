It's free and may be worthwhile to give it a try to see if it can help you reduce potential bugs in the code so that diminish future actual debugging hours.  I might be wrong with any of my understandings though.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the debugging of an existing bug in the Python code, my personal experience with the PyCharm IDE has been good and sufficient so far.</p>",
