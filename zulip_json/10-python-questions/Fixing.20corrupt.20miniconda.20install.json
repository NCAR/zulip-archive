Now when I switch environments, my command prompt does not update, and I am not sure if this is bad. But I can recreate all of my local environments if needed.  Any recommendations on how to best fix or reinstall? Is recreating the base environment sufficient?    I gave the command <code>conda update -n base</code>, and a bunch of  packages including conda were updated successfully, but there is still a problem with the command prompt, and I just want to be safe.</p>",
