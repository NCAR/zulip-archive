I tried something like:</p>\n<p>from scipy import interpolate</p>\n<p>zkm = np.arange(1.,50.,2.)<br>\nf = interpolate.interp2d(Z3*1e-3, X, zkm)</p>\n<p>where Z3 and X are single location timeseries from a CESM run, and so just level and time. In this example, I am trying to put it on a 2 km grid.<br>\nBut it expects zkm to be the same size as Z3,X. I really just need to do 1-D interpolation in the vertical, so interp2d seems overkill. Apart from looping over time and doing 1d interpolation is there an elegant way to do this?</p>\n<p>thanks,</p>\n<p>Dan</p>",
