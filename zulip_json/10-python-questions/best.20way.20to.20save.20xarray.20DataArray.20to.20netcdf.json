You don't specify a new name when encoding, instead you can use <code>name=&lt;str&gt;</code> on DataArray creation or modify an existing DataArray with <code>da.name = &lt;str&gt;</code>.

The lat/lon are indeed written to the resulting file as coordinates, but before I write to netcdf I use <a href=\"http://da.name\">da.name</a> = &lt;str&gt; to define the variable name.  This way I don't even have to use 'encoding' unless I want to change something about the way that variable is saved (like it's type).  Works now - thanks!</p>",
