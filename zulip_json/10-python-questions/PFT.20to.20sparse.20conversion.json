It looks like you are using code from the <a href=\"https://ncar.github.io/esds/posts/2022/sparse-PFT-gridding/\">sparse-PFT-gridding notebook</a> which works when you have CLM output indexed by <code>pft</code>. Unfortunately it won't work in this case with the indexing by <code>lndgrid</code>. It also looks like your data is indexed by <code>ncol</code> in which case it would be quite analogous to working with CAM-SE output.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"34\">@Stephen Yeager</span> came up with a workaround similar to how remapping is done for CAM-SE output that I believe he already shared with you, but I'll post here so everyone else can see the solution: <code>/glade/u/home/yeager/analysis/python/toshare/CLM_field_regrid.ipynb</code></p>",
