VAPOR provides interactive 3D rendering (e.g. isosurfaces, volume rendering, cutting planes, and flow visualization) of geoscience data sets. The team would love some input from the Scientific Python user community to help guide the API development, functionality requirements, and even design choices. If you are interested in Python based 3D visualization for your data, this is your chance to help influence  this exciting project. Please reply to this stream or email the team at <a href=\"mailto:vapor@ucar.edu\">vapor@ucar.edu</a>. Thanks!</p>",
