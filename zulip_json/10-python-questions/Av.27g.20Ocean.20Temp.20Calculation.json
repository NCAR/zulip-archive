I'm using the weighted function to weight by the layer thickness, but most of my result ends up being NANs because of they are present at depth in shallower areas.  Is there a way around this? I've taken a few screenshots of simplified workflow showing the basic issue.  Any thoughts on how to work around this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9b/wz-_7z7LY_rNRz8WDyDklBoc/Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.00-AM-2.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.00-AM-2.png</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6e/ZOJpRi12FPy3LhoCyAWbOBsL/Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.05-AM-2.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.05-AM-2.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9b/wz-_7z7LY_rNRz8WDyDklBoc/Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.00-AM-2.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.00-AM-2.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/9b/wz-_7z7LY_rNRz8WDyDklBoc/Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.00-AM-2.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6e/ZOJpRi12FPy3LhoCyAWbOBsL/Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.05-AM-2.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.05-AM-2.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/6e/ZOJpRi12FPy3LhoCyAWbOBsL/Screen-Shot-2022-06-10-at-11.44.05-AM-2.png\"></a></div>",
