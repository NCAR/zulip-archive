I'm just trying to take an xarray dataset of anemometer data that has multiple variables, and chop the whole dataset to only be the times where 'wspd' is in it's top 10%. Take a look at the screenshots of code that I've attached and let me know if you see where I'm going wrong, or if there is just a better way to be going about this! Thanks so much!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/2a/YbcESnEbgkAGQvNXNe2rhVH4/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.11-AM.png\">Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.11-AM.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8a/zokaLEFf1dJtExLjBIGWSIvA/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.44-AM.png\">Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.44-AM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/2a/YbcESnEbgkAGQvNXNe2rhVH4/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.11-AM.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.11-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/2a/YbcESnEbgkAGQvNXNe2rhVH4/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.11-AM.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8a/zokaLEFf1dJtExLjBIGWSIvA/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.44-AM.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.44-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/8a/zokaLEFf1dJtExLjBIGWSIvA/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-10.48.44-AM.png\"></a></div>",

The one thing is that it seems that it cut out more than I would've expected (just by a little bit), and if I remember correctly from when I was looking into 'quantile', I feel like I remember there are different options for how it handles duplicate values... do you think maybe that's why it cut out a little extra?<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/89/28_LN8GSMh4ZAIgJgjS6K9VQ/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-2.13.43-PM.png\">Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-2.13.43-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/89/28_LN8GSMh4ZAIgJgjS6K9VQ/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-2.13.43-PM.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-2.13.43-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/89/28_LN8GSMh4ZAIgJgjS6K9VQ/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-2.13.43-PM.png\"></a></div>",
