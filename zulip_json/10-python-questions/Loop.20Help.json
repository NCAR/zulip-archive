Let's say I have a dataframe, that's over hundreds of lines long full of records of wind data from months. The only thing separating one record from the next that is identifiable, is a Pressure column. By that I mean each new record can be identified because the Pressure level of 1000mb repeats when a new record starts (ill include an image below). Say that I need to find certain things in each record. How can I start this loop, telling my code... For Pressure level between 1000mb and the last -9999.0 mb before the next record starts, do ___. I need it to loop between 1000mb and the last pressure value each time before a new record starts. <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4e/R7mX-toJV36OkYuyYZ_9zCCH/Capture.PNG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Capture.PNG\">Capture.PNG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4e/R7mX-toJV36OkYuyYZ_9zCCH/Capture.PNG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Capture.PNG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/4e/R7mX-toJV36OkYuyYZ_9zCCH/Capture.PNG\"></a></div>",
