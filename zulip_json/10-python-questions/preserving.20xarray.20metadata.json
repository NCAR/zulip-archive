The variable also has attributes associated with it, i.e. ds.&lt;var&gt;.attrs returns a non-empty dictionary.   When I multiply the variable by some weights and assign to a new variable (ds2 = ds.&lt;var&gt; * ds_wts, it seems the attrs are dropped, but I need to keep them.   Is this expected behavior?  Is there some way to preserve metadata over computations?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks for your ideas.  I will give them a try.   I thought for a while about suggesting that xarray should give precedence to the metadata from the \"left\" operand. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">ds</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;var&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">ds</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;var&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">ds_wts</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>...would keep the metadata from ds[\"var\"] unchanged.   But I suppose it is not clear whether the metadata from ds_wts should be added in if it does not conflict, or if it should be left out by default.  It seems there is no automatic, intuitive way to handle metadata with math operations, and the best approach is probably to implement the flag \"keep_attrs\" to let the user decide.</p>",
