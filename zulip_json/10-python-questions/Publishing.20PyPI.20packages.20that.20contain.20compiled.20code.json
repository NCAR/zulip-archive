This is potentially challenging because it depends on a build of ESMF, which I think means we need to create / publish platform-specific wheels. There is already a conda-based ESMPy package, which depends on a conda ESMF package, but a number of people have requested a PyPI package as well.</p>\n<p>Does anyone here have experience publishing PyPI packages that contain compiled code? If so, would you have time to talk to me about what it involves? As a first step, I'm just trying to gauge how challenging / time-consuming this will be to set up.</p>",
