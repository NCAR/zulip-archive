What I'd like to do is have a flexible subroutine that's doing something with an xarray data array along a dimension specified as input to this subroutine i.e., as a simple example would be something like...</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>def function(x, dim):\n    y = x.isel(dim=slice(0,10))\n    return y\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Suppose x has dimensions [model, lat, lon] and I want to get the slice along the model dimension I'd call this using...</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>y = function(x, &#39;model&#39;)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But this doesn't work because it thinks I want to do the slicing along dimension \"dim\" as opposed to using the string that I've passed through the be variable \"dim\".  Is there a way around this?  Thanks in advance for any help!</p>",
