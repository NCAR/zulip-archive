I have also made my own environment because I wanted to become familiar with that.  I have the same environment on cheyenne and the cgd machines and I can successfully install my package on the cgd machines using \"pip install -e . --user\".  I can also successfully install it on cheyenne in the base environment but when I try to do it within my own environment, I get an error ValueError: source code string cannot contain null bytes.  I can send along the longer error trace if that's helpful.</p>\n<p>Googling suggests to me there is some kind of corrupt file somewhere.  I have cleared the pip cache but that didn't help.  Does anyone know what to do?</p>\n<p>I am working here /home/islas/python/ecpaper2020/</p>\n<p>and trying to install ecpaper_utils.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>",
