I have used xarray.Dataset.assign a good number of times in other places, but it seems to be acting weird in this instance. I am trying to add this new list, 'lapse_rate', as a variable in df (which is an existing dataset), but it seems to want to add it to the coordinates for some reason. (I have even tried to use xarray.Dataset.reset_coords to just move it despite this, but it gives me an error)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/bd/zPS2nh89bQoSpHRDnkjG3yDi/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/bd/zPS2nh89bQoSpHRDnkjG3yDi/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/bd/zPS2nh89bQoSpHRDnkjG3yDi/image.png\"></a></div>",
