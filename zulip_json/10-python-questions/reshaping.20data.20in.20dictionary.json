I have been using the CMIP6 catalog, although it seems quite incomplete (only a few models have CO2 data for the historical simulation, and some of these don't have the associated area and land fraction variables required for analysis. It looks like the script you pointed me to might have examples of more powerful ways of searching the catalog than I was previously aware of, so I will play around with some of those!</p>",
