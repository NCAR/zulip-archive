The goal is not to demonstrate a feature-complete solution, but to introduce a range of methods and rigorously compare their performance. Perhaps surprisingly, I show that NetCDF is a perfectly acceptable format for training ML models and may outperform some “native” TensorFlow formats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
