Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) have the potential to advance Earth system science understanding, analysis, modeling, prediction, and decision making.</p>\n<p>This three-day workshop will bring together Earth system science experts, machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers, social and behavioral scientists, ethicists, and decision-makers across sectors to explore opportunities and challenges, including the ethical development and use, of using ML/AI to advance Earth system science. Workshop discussions will examine state-of-the-art approaches for using ML/AI for Earth system science, consider challenges and ways to mitigate risks of using ML/AI, and identify future opportunities to accelerate progress.
