I am attempting to create plots of virtual transects that match real world ship tracks and want to be sure I am selecting lats/lons that match real world routes. In addition, when plotting I am using pcolor and need to use TLAT/TLONG values as well so I want to be sure what I select makes sense for real world lats/lons as well. Thanks for your reply!</p>",
