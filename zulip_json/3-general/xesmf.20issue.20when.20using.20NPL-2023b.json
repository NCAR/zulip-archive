I had to downgrade to version 8.2.0 for both to resolve the issue. Digging a little further, it looks like the issue I was having has since been <a href=\"https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf/pull/151\">resolved with esmf version 8.5.0</a>, while the npl-2023b environment is still using 8.4.2. This would be a great issue to open in the <a href=\"https://github.com/NCAR/ncar-conda/issues\">ncar-conda repo</a> to request the newer version, and in the meantime you could try your own environment with the updated packages to see if that works.</p>",
