        "content": "<p>Hi everyone. I am very new to the python ecosystem, so apologies if this is obvious, or an ill-formed question.  Using a typical cshell batch script, I am trying to run a series of .py files that I originally developed as notebooks.  I am now in production mode and would like to use the batch/qsub workflow outside of Jupyterhub, for efficiency-sake.  I developed the scripts using the \"NPL (conda)  kernal from the Jupyterhub framework, so I would like to use the same python environment. I have checked  <a href=\"http://url\">https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581396#StartingCasperjobswithPBS-Fortcshusers</a> and <a href=\"http://url\">https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/83853599#UsingCondaandPython-UsingCondainbatchjobs</a>, but I am still failing to execute the correct module and/or environment sequence.  Does anyone have an example they would be willing to share? Thanks!</p>",
