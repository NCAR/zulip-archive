This is helpful! The way it was explained to me is that the maps where we could click to navigate would use GeoJSON. Then there would be  heatmaps of climate data would use the GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF format makes more intuitive sense to me. But if someone in the GIS program (and is on this list) has insight that would be helpful. I did reach out to someone there and have not yet heard back.</p>",

I emailed Jenn about this and she's looking at one of my files I'm hoping to convert in the next few days. I'd be happy to get any advice you have as well. I'm not sure how much you and Jenn talk, so I don't want to ask you both the same questions. I am a total newbie at this an mainly want to figure out a workflow so that I can make the files myself since I will have several to make for the GeoTIFFs at least.</p>",
