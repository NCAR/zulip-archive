I have some code to convert the raw BESS tiles (<a href=\"http://environment.snu.ac.kr/bess_flux/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://environment.snu.ac.kr/bess_flux/\">http://environment.snu.ac.kr/bess_flux/</a>) into a gridded product, but they're hosted as 1-km resolution tiles on an FTP server so it'll be a long endeavor. Wanted to check here first.</p>",
