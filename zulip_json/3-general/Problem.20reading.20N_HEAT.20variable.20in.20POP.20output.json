The data looks fine when I choose transport_reg = 0 (global).  However, when I choose transport_reg (atlantic), all the data comes back as nans.  When I look at the file in ncview, I see some nan's (which I expected to see), but there are also actual data there as well that apparently aren't being read or detected. I have attached a screenshot showing a simple example of this.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have experience with reading N_HEAT and know how to get around this?<br>\nThanks!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/5c/apHXx8ufK-BI_0zI_2seztU9/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-12.23.46-PM-2.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-12.23.46-PM-2.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/5c/apHXx8ufK-BI_0zI_2seztU9/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-12.23.46-PM-2.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-12.23.46-PM-2.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/5c/apHXx8ufK-BI_0zI_2seztU9/Screen-Shot-2022-04-21-at-12.23.46-PM-2.png\"></a></div>",

So it was either written then, or predates that. I think the meridional transport was written by Gokhan. I later wrote code to write out lateral diffusive tracer fluxes. This was added to the code in April 2010. It seems that one could have gone back and updated the meridional transport code to use the lateral diffusive tracers fluxes on the regional boundary, but this was never done.</p>",
