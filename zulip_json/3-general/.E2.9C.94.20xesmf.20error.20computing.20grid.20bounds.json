The <code>cf.get_bounds()</code> returns bounds that already exist, while <code>cf.add_bounds</code> attempts to guess them. I continue to have a lot of difficulty using xesmf for conservative regridding when lon/lat are 2D arrays because Regridder does not know how to generate the lon_bnds/lat_bnds that should have dimension (ny+1,nx+1). Seems like that has to be done by hand before calling xesmf.</p>",
