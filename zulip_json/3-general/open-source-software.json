So much of this resonates with me, and hopefully this is a great read for you as well</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link: <a href=\"https://coiled.io/blog/stages-of-openness.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://coiled.io/blog/stages-of-openness.html\">https://coiled.io/blog/stages-of-openness.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Too Long; Didn’t Read</em>: </p>\n<p><strong>1.  Publicly visible source code</strong></p>\n<p>--&gt;  We uploaded our code to GitHub/GitLab, etc... </p>\n<p><strong>2.  Licensed for reuse</strong> </p>\n<p>--&gt; And we let people use it for free, even if they do things that we don't like (they make a ton of money with it <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> , or build bombs with it <span aria-label=\"frown\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f641\" role=\"img\" title=\"frown\">:frown:</span> ) </p>\n<p><strong>3.  Accepting contributions</strong></p>\n<p>--&gt; And if they submit a bug fix, we’ll take the time to look at it, and work with them to merge it in, even if it takes time away from our normal work</p>\n<p><strong>4.  Open development</strong></p>\n<p>--&gt; And when we work we’ll make sure that all of our communication happens in the open as well, so that others can see what we’re doing and why.  We do this even though it might not be the easiest path for us to communicate internally </p>\n<p><strong>5.  Open decision making</strong></p>\n<p>--&gt; And now that communication is open to the public, everyone can weigh in, vote, and determine what happens to the project, even if it's not entirely in our own interest.  We give up control to others outside of our organization.  This is great, and scary.</p>\n<p><strong>6.  Multi-institution engagement</strong></p>\n<p>--&gt; This happens so much that no single institution or individual has control over the project, including us.</p>\n<p><strong>7.  Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>--&gt; And so now we can retire, and know that the software will live on forever without really missing us at all <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>",
