I can do something similar to this pangeo example with POP temperature output: <br>\n<a href=\"https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/NCAR/notebook-gallery/notebooks/Run-Anywhere/Ocean-Heat-Content/OHC_tutorial.html\">https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/NCAR/notebook-gallery/notebooks/Run-Anywhere/Ocean-Heat-Content/OHC_tutorial.html</a><br>\nWhat  I'd  like to do is be able to compute integrated ocean heat content over time, but do this for global, atlantic, and other specified regions.   I don't think the .TEMP. variable lends itself well to this, unless I use masks.  Is there another variable that is better for this?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
