Another possibility was linearly interpolating each month from 1990 to 1996 (e.g. drawing a line from Jan 1990 - Jan 1996 and using those values to compute Jan '91, '92, '93, '94, and '95 then doing the same for Feb and so on)</p>",

His method is doing what you want: remove Pinatubo from the forcing and have a 'clean' emission file. I think the figure indicates this is fine. Hard to tell how smooth it is in either side given the scale, but I think it's fine and serves the purpose. If there are some subtle jumps, maybe a linear ramp is needed, but I doubt it.</p>",
