Pinatubo.</p>\n<p>Hypothesis 2: After the initial uptake anomaly due to Mt. Pinatubo, thermocline anomalies that are cool and anomalously high in tracers return to the surface. These anomalies suppress air-to-sea fluxes for up to a decade after the eruption.</p>\n<p>Hypothesis 3: By including the seasonal cycle and latitudinal distribution of atmospheric pCO2 in simulations, variability of the globally integrated air-sea carbon flux is increased and becomes more comparable to observationally-based estimates.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We planning to replicate a period of the CESM1-LE spanning the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption, censoring the volcanic aerosol forcing from this event.  By comparing these runs with the full CESM-LE, we aim to quantify the effects the Mt. Pinatubo eruption explicitly.</p>\n<p>Repository for developing these runs:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/matt-long/pinatubo-LE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/matt-long/pinatubo-LE\">https://github.com/matt-long/pinatubo-LE</a></p>",
