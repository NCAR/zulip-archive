We’ll be sharing more details and invitations soon, but in the meantime I wanted to share some information regarding timelines and archives and give folks the opportunity to raise any questions or concerns.  </p>\n<p>In terms of timelines, Zulip will continue to be available through May 16, 2025 at which point it will go read-only and be decommissioned shortly thereafter.  Public streams will be archived and available here: <a href=\"https://ncar.github.io/zulip-archive/\">https://ncar.github.io/zulip-archive/</a>.  However, data from <em>private streams and direct messages will not be archived</em> so we encourage you to transfer any information that might be needed from those as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>You can expect invitations to the Slack workspace sometime late this week and we’ll be looking for feedback from folks regarding how to make that space work best for our community.  </p>\n<p>If you have questions or concerns you can reach out to me via DM or email.</p>",
