There were two big things going wrong:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After reading in <code>FESEDFLUX</code> from disk, I was trying to accumulate all the flux from below the ocean floor into the layer containing <code>bathyT</code>... but it turned out that when <code>bathyT</code> was exactly equal to a layer interface depth on the forcing grid, it would accumulate into the layer below <code>bathyT</code> instead of above it. So we were losing all the sub-floor flux in many columns</li>\n<li>Keith pointed out that <code>FESEDFLUX</code> is the only diagnostic we have where we want to conserve the column sum when vertically interpolating. It turns out that there is a specific flag to use when registering a diagnostics (<code>v_extensive = .true.</code>) to conserve the column sum when remapping from the model vertical to whatever grid is being used when writing history files.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also had a bug in my notebook that compares the column sums: I was writing the MOM output to a history file that used the POP vertical levels to make it easy to compare the input and output files. However, the MOM output has missing values below <code>bathyT</code> while the forcing file has full columns at every ocean cell (I believe the forcing file that was mapped from the POP horizontal to the MOM horizontal has 0s below <code>KMT</code>).</p>\n<p>Lastly, I added a step to the generation of the forcing file. I now apply the POP land mask to the source file, and then use <code>pop-tools</code> to laterally fill the land before mapping to MOM (and the POP -&gt; MOM mapping file does not know about the POP land mask). I had noticed some weird patterns of 0s in the MOM forcing file that I traced to areas of the globe that are land in POP but open ocean in MOM (e.g. between Australia and Papua New Guinea) and this seemed like a reasonable way to avoid those patterns.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think everything is resolved now and I've launched <code>mom_oob.003</code> and <code>mom_hybrid_z.003</code> with these updates. <span aria-label=\"fingers crossed\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f91e\" role=\"img\" title=\"fingers crossed\">:fingers_crossed:</span></p>",
