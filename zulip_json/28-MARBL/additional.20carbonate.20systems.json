Looking through the MARBL code it seems to my eye that the way to go for this is to add an extra dimension to every associated variable, with N entries. Are there any existing examples in MARBL of 4d fields? Or perhaps there is a better idea of how this might be implemented?<br>\nThanks!<br>\nDafydd</p>",
