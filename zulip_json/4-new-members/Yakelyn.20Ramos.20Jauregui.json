My research focuses on MJO-ENSO interaction from a physical mechanism perspective and I mostly work with observations (satellites + in-situ). I work under the supervision of Prof. Shuyi S. Chen and at NCAR with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"48\">@Judith Berner</span> . I will be in Boulder for 2 months using CESM2 outputs and I will appreciate any help if I run into python coding issues. Happy to chat about my exciting research  :)</p>",
