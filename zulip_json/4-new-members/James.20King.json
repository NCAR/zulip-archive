I'm a postdoc at the University of Sheffield in the UK, and will be heading to NCAR in August to work with Peter Lawrence in the Terrestrial Sciences Section of CGD. I work on a project evaluating nature-based CDR strategies for unforeseen earth system consequences. Working a lot with CESM generally and CLM/CAM-Chem specifically, and looking to advance my Python skills in handling model data. Nice to be here!</p>",
