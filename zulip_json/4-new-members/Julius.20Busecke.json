Scientifically I am a 'biogeochemically curious' physical oceanographer, interested in all kinds of fun stuff, but recently very much focused on all things CMIP6. About half of my work is dedicated to science and the other half to Open Source Software development within the broader pangeo stack. Always keen to chat about science, coding, coffee or whatever else is fun. <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>",
