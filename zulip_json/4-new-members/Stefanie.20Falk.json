I'm particularly interested in ozone though tout the whole atmospheric domain (from stratospheric depletion and VSLS, spring-time Arctic depletion due to bromine explosions, air quality, plant health...). In recent years I have been focussing on ozone-vegetation interactions which brought me to the CLM/CESM. I'm experienced in python, fortran, c++/c, and bash programming. I've also done some programming in java (when it was still a common joke to refer to the island) and assembler. Nice to meet all of you!</p>",
