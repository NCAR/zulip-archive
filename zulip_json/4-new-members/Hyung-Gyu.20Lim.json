I'm a postdoc recently joined at UC San Diego working with Colleen Petrik, and I will be focusing on CESM-FOSI, CESM-DPLE driven FEISTY simulation for fish predictability. My background is climate dynamics and my previous works were about chlorophyll-climate interaction and feedback in tropical pacific and polar oceans using GFDL models. I'm very exciting to do this project and hope I can learn many things through new model and new project . It's very nice to join here and I'm looking forward to work with you!</p>",
