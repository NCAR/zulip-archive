I'm trying to calculate the linear trend of temperature over time at each lat/lon gridpoint. I have monthly temperature data (K) so I assumed the coefficients would output as K/month, but the first degree <code>polyfit_coefficients</code> are order 10^-18 which is way too small. I'm wondering if cftime is using some base time units or reference time that causes the magnitude to be small, because the spatial pattern actually looks ok. I'm using xarray version 17.0 which seems to have polyfit implemented accounting for datetime (see also <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/3349\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/3349\">https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/3349</a>).</p>",
