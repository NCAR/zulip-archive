I am plotting it's mean, +/-std, +/-2std and max and min. I was wondering if anyone has suggestions about how to shift the time axis to begin July 1 and replace dayofyear with month in the x-axis labels.  I could brute force it by plotting vs. doy2 = np.mod((doy+180),365) but that causes wrapping artifacts in the plot that I can deal with but it's not elegant. Here's the current figure:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f/paU70tIQOI9xLrBIzErqB1GH/u60n.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"u60n.png\">u60n.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f/paU70tIQOI9xLrBIzErqB1GH/u60n.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"u60n.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/f/paU70tIQOI9xLrBIzErqB1GH/u60n.png\"></a></div>",
