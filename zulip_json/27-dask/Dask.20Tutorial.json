This tutorial will be focused on effective HPC and Dask usage for the Earth Science community. The tutorial will be tailored both for those who are familiar with Python but are not using Dask extensively and for those who use Dask regularly but would like to learn more about optimization guidance and tips/tricks. We would like to solicit feedback on topics of interest for this tutorial from the community. Are there any particular Dask-related topics that our community would like to be covered in this tutorial?<br>\nHappy Holidays!<br>\nNegin Sobhani on behalf of Dask mini-tutorial organization team</p>",
