        "content": "<p>Hi,<br>\nI'm running into a strange issue when I multiply two dask arrays who have the same dimensions.  Each array has dimension z_t=60, but when I multiply them together the resultant array has only 16 z_t levels. When I manually compute the first 16 entries element by element, they do appear to be correct. I've added screenshots of the arrays, and the results of a very simple example of this issue.  I cannot seem to understand what is going on here. Any help appreciated. <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/2c/FKo97d8nvSg68YkH3Kf9TAQi/Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.10-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.10-PM.png</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/b2/AoFEDLeLTUkYinng51uA605W/Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.18-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.18-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/2c/FKo97d8nvSg68YkH3Kf9TAQi/Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.10-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.10-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/2c/FKo97d8nvSg68YkH3Kf9TAQi/Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.10-PM.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/b2/AoFEDLeLTUkYinng51uA605W/Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.18-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.18-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/b2/AoFEDLeLTUkYinng51uA605W/Screen-Shot-2022-05-06-at-6.36.18-PM.png\"></a></div>",

Should pop-tools be changed so that the <code>z_t</code> that it generates is consistent with default model output?</p>",
