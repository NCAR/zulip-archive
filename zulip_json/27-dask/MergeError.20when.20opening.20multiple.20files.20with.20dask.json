The error says:<br>\nMergeError: conflicting values for variable 'REGION_MASK' on objects to be combined. You can skip this check by specifying compat='override'.</p>\n<p>I've tried the suggestion to add compat='override' but it does not help, instead producing a new error:<br>\nValueError: Cannot specify both coords='different' and compat='override'.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have advice on how to overcome this?  If I process the data in smaller subsets (every 1000 years) the error does not appear, but then I still have to merge them after so it doesn't exactly help.  Thanks for any help!</p>",

        "content": "<p>For some reason the <code>REGION_MASK</code> variable is different in these files. To pass <code>compat=\"override\"</code> you'll have to pass <code>coords=\"minimal\"</code> too. This will ignore any differences in <code>REGION_MASK</code> and other coordinate variables and just pick values from the first file. By default <code>coords=\"different\"</code>, which means xarray will try to see if the values are different in different files. If so, it will add a new dimension and concatenate them.</p>",
