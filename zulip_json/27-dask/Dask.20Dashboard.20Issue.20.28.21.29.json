The timing of things breaking made us initially suspicious that it was some issue with the Casper refresh, but after doing some investigation I believe we are seeing an incompatibility/bug between bokeh 3.3.x and Dask dashboards that a served via a proxy, as we do in the JupyterHub. For more details, see this GitHub issue:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/8333\">https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/8333</a></p>\n<p>Until this gets resolved with new package releases, make sure you fix the bokeh package to 3.2 or earlier when creating new conda environments that will run Dask. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>mamba create -n new-env bokeh=3.2 dask ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Hope this helps you avoid some headaches!</p>",
