That being said, for a few images I'm trying to use HTML syntax to have a little more control over the size and location of the image but these do not load on the published site (they do load in the preview in the repository however). I figure this should be a simple issue to fix, but I cannot figure out what I have wrong (I assume it's something I'm missing in my config file?). Here are links  to my <a href=\"https://github.com/brmy4086/ARTMIP\">repository</a> and <a href=\"https://brmy4086.github.io/ARTMIP/\">site</a> (for reference, the images on the Experimental Design page are ones with this issue).</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any ideas or tips!<br>\nBest,<br>\nBrendan</p>",

I tried adding the underscore and that didn't do the trick.
