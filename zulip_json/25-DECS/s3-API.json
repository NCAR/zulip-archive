I put the isd_s3.ini config file in the same directory as the rda AWS credentials configuration (/glade/u/home/rdadata/.aws), since this seems like the most logical place for it to reside.  I think this type of configuration setup (reading from a config file) should be completely detached from the package repo.  It should be up to other users to decide if they want to implement their own config file setup when they develop their own apps.  Config options supported by the package can be 1. Environment variables or 2. Command line argument input</p>",
