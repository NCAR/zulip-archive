This points to <code>fi_20200221</code> for <code>FMS</code> and <code>mi_20200309</code> for <code>MOM_interface</code>. These seem rather dated. I tried pointing to a more recent <code>MOM_interface</code> tag, but then had problems with <code>FMS</code>. What should I use in Externals.cfg to get more recent MOM developments?</p>",

As best as I can tell, there is something in <code>cime5.8.36</code> that does not play nicely with the FMS tag <code>fi_20201112</code> so the key takeaway from following the quickstart you linked is that the recommended CESM tag drops CIME to <code>cime5.8.32</code>. I haven't tested any of the tags between 5.8.32 and 5.8.36 to narrow down exactly what the issue is (and for the moment I don't plan to, since my sandbox appears to be working now) but I figured this info might be useful to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"98\">@Alper Altuntas</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"15\">@Gustavo M Marques</span> as they work towards updating MOM and FMS in the CESM 2.3 alpha / beta series</p>",
