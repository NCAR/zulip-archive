However, I see <code>{tracer}_dfx</code> and <code>{tracer}_dfy</code>as registered as diffusive zonal flux. So I'm confused. Maybe these aren't supported by the neutral mixing scheme, but are always registered. (I suspect <code>{tracer}_dfy</code> being labeled as diffusive zonal flux is a bug, and that it should be diffusive meridional flux.) I don't think there is an analogue for <code>HDIFB_{tracer}</code> with MOM's neutral mixing. The convergence of these fluxes are in the variables <code>{tracer}_dfxy_conc_tendency</code> and the related fields<code>{tracer}_dfxy_cont_tendency</code>.</li>\n<li>I don't see analogues for these in <code>register_tracer_diagnostics</code> or <code>MOM_CVMix_KPP.F90</code>, though the latter does have <code>KPP_NLtransport_heat</code> and <code>KPP_NLtransport_salt</code>, which appear to be analogues specific for temperature and salinity.</li>\n</ol>",

For (3), are you suggesting I add <code>{tracer}_dfx</code> and <code>{tracer}_dfy</code> to replace <code>HDIFE_{tracer}</code> and <code>HDIFN_{tracer}</code>, respectively? Would it also be helpful to include <code>{tracer}_dfxy_conc_tendency</code> and <code>{tracer}_dfxy_cont_tendency</code>? It looks like POP includes the <code>HDIF</code> terms for tracers where we want to compute budgets: Fe, O2, DIC, DIC_ALT_CO2, DOC, and DOCr, and from your comment it isn't clear if the convergence terms are necessary.</p>\n<p>I'll look into the KPP module this afternoon, thanks for pointing me in the right direction.</p>",

It doesn't do diagnostic restarts. Some implications:<br>\n1) If you're generating monthly/annual means, your restart boundaries need to be on monthly/annual boundaries respectively.<br>\n2) We use annual means for some MARBL tracer budget terms, to reduce output volume. So we'll need to be restricted to running in yearly segments, or output these terms at a higher frequency and do a data reduction offline.<br>\n3) If you want to directly generate 5-day and monthly means simultaneously, you need to run in yearly segments. If you cannot run in yearly segments, e.g. hi-res runs, the alternative is to directly generate daily and monthly means, and then average the daily means to 5-day means. Alistair said this is what he does, with a sad emoji.</p>",
