We've been internally discussing trying to make our BGC models (CMOC and CanOE) model-agnostic as there are a number of academic/government applications requiring some kind of BGC module, but are ROMS or FVCOM based. Considering that we're going to need to refactor them anyway to make them compatible with an upgrade to NEMO 4.0, I wanted to know if there would be interest on your side of 1) incorporating the interface into NEMO (which is more similar to POP in terms of timestepping) and 2) including CMOC and CanOE as alternatives to MARBL. When <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"10\">@Michael Levy</span> followsup on his hooking up MARBL to MOM6, would <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"14\">@Matt Long</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"31\">@Keith Lindsay</span> mind hopping on briefly as well to discuss this?</p>",

I think we've learned things from the MARBL effort that would be useful in this regard. </p>\n<p>Collaborators have started (and stalled out) on implementing MARBL in ROMS, but I don't think we uncovered any fundamental show-stoppers in the implementation path there. </p>\n<p>One path forward here would be to refactor the MARBL code into (1) a General-Interface-for-OBMs (GIOBM)  and (2) the MARBL ecosystem model itself. We could collaborate on development of GIOBM (hard to pronounce, I am finding) and various model groups could choose to implement this and re-write their models in compatible ways. </p>\n<p>I've spoken with Fei Chai at U Maine about this; he develops CoSiNE, which is a model distributed with ROMS. He's interested. </p>\n<p>Funding is a key question for us.</p>",
