We're trying to identify use cases and needed capabilities in this area, and encourage users of these models to reach out. We'd like to hear about your workflow (current or future) with these data, what is working for you, and what is not working.</p>",

There would naturally be an emphasis on dealing with unstructured grids (CAM-SE, FV3, and MPAS). I wonder if it would be worthwhile to go in together on one proposal? We should loop Rich Neale into the conversation, and possibly others. Maybe a meeting in January?</p>",
