If anyone is interested you can see the gallery here: <a href=\"https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html\">https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html</a></p>\n<p>We have been discussing interesting questions such as when to copy the NCL example 1-to-1 in appearance and when to use more current standards (no more rainbow color maps!), how to make these plots more searchable by feature, and most importantly when to write new functions for geocat-viz or geocat-comp based on common workflows or unique NCL functions we encounter throughout the process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"19\">@John Clyne</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"8\">@Kevin Paul</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"18\">@Orhan Eroglu</span> and I are all really proud of our students' work towards the progress and growth of this gallery, and we feel it hosts enough diverse examples that it is a potentially a valuable resource for anybody working in Python.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you have opinions on what kinds of plots we should prioritize as the gallery continues to expand.</p>",
