This would allow a CESM diagnostic package to rely on <code>intake-esm</code> to read data into DataSets and abstract away the need to know what data is in what file in the archive.</p>\n<p>This will likely change the <code>intake-esm</code> interface quite a bit - currently, <code>open_esm_datastore()</code> expects a path to a json file as an argument; that file points to a <code>csv</code> file (that actually contains the data such as file paths and variable names) and also tells <code>intake-esm</code> how to interpret said data. We hope to standardize the information in the json file, and eventually update the <code>open_esm_datastore()</code> API such that it expects a path to the csv file and another argument such as <code>spec=\"cesm\"</code> that replaces the need for the json file.</p>\n<p>We are still in early stages of this project, and encourage any feedback, concerns, or assistance you want to offer. I suspect this will be my focus in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"21\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/21-hack-projects\">#hack-projects</a> for the next several months</p>",

The only thing we have close to a standard for ESM data is CMIP. So, I think we should be spending our effort getting CESM to output CMIP-compliant data. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much of the Earth science community uses and is familiar with the CF Conventions, whereas only CMIP people are familiar with the CMIP conventions, so I would argue that CF is \"more standard.\" As far as I know, neither has been officially adopted by a standards-developing organization, although CF-NetCDF3 was adopted by the Open Geospatial Consortium in ~2010 (thanks to the work of Ben Domenico at Unidata).</p>\n<p>I am curious which aspects of CESM should be made more standard, and whether some aspects are covered only by CF or only by CMIP, or are covered by both in a contradictory fashion.</p>\n<p>Personally, I find it unfortunate that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The variable names are different in CESM/CMIP and CESM/LENS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CF Standard Names are buried in the metadata rather than exposed at the file/object level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In LENS, there are a number of gratuitous incompatibilities requiring a human, e.g.:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Some fields have different short names depending on whether monthly or daily (e.g., aice vs aice_d).<br>\n   [I realize the ice model needs to do it this way, but it could have been fixed in post-processing.]</li>\n<li>Some fields have different short names but the same long name (e.g., SST, TEMP = Potential Temperature).<br>\n   [I realize SST = TEMP @ surface, but still this is bad practice.]</li>\n<li>Some fields are the same but express the units differently (e.g., atmos TAUX  is N/m2, but land TAUX is in kg/m/s^2).<br>\n   [I realize 1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2]</li>\n<li>Squared units are expressed as s2 or m2 at some times, and s^2 or m^2 at others.</li>\n<li>TAUX2 is wind stress squared for ocean monthly, but TAUX_2 is wind stress (not squared) for ocean daily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At least some of these things can be made more standard at the Intake-ESM level, as I will demonstrate on Wed Mar 27 at 09:00 MDT.</p>",
