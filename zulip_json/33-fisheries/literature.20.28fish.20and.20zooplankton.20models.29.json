Ontogeny has profound implications on population dynamics and community structure. Our aim is to provide a generic food-web framework of planktonic communities that accounts for zooplankton ontogeny. We propose a model framework along the Nutrient–Unicellular–Multicellular axis – a “NUM” framework – as an alternative to the NPZ modelling paradigm. NUM is a mechanistic size- and trait-based model based on traits and trade-offs at the individual level. Here the multicellular component describes the population dynamics of key copepod groups, characterized by their adult size and feeding mode. The unicellular compartment accounts for auto- mixo- and heterotrophic protists. We also consider nitrogen dynamics and carbon export from copepod fecal pellets. All parameters have been fitted to cross-species data.<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007966112030207X\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007966112030207X\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007966112030207X</a></p>",
