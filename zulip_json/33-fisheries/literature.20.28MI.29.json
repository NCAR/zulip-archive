We analyzed past regional variability and future changes in the Metabolic<br>\nIndex (Φ), a species-specific measure of the environment’s capacity to meet temperature-dependent organismal<br>\noxygen demand. Across the traits of diverse animals, Φ exhibits strong seasonal to interdecadal variations<br>\nthroughout the CCS, implying that resident species already experience large fluctuations in available aerobic habitat. For a key CCS species, northern anchovy, the long-term biogeographic distribution and decadal fluctuations in abundance are both highly coherent with aerobic habitat volume. Ocean warming and oxygen loss by 2100 are<br>\nprojected to decrease Φ below critical levels in 30 to 50% of anchovies’ present range, including complete loss of<br>\naerobic habitat—and thus likely extirpation—from the southern CCS. Aerobic habitat loss will vary widely across<br>\nthe traits of CCS taxa, disrupting ecological interactions throughout the region.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/20/eaay3188.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/20/eaay3188.full.pdf\">https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/20/eaay3188.full.pdf</a></p>",
