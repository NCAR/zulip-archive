I have a few questions about getting it all set up, though.</p>\n<p>First off, the high-res run was a hybrid case that used physics from a run Alper did. He had run 4 61-year JRA cycles, and I don't think there is a comparable one-degree case... so as a first step I was going to run a 4-cycle case (without BGC). Some questions about that run:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should we stick with the 61-year JRA cycles (which matches what our high-res run used), or switch to 63-year cycles?</li>\n<li>The high-res runs use a stub wave model instead of WW3 - should we turn off the wave model in the 1 degree run?</li>\n<li>The high-res runs use CICE4 instead of CICE5 - which version of CICE should we use in the 1 degree run?</li>\n<li>The high-res run does not use the estuary box model (or the EBM is configured to be \"partially on\", as I think Keith phrased it) -- should we mimic those settings in the 1 degree run, or use the out-of-the-box EBM settings?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are also three CICE namelist changes (<code>ndtd=2</code>, <code>r_snw=1.00</code>, <code>f_blkmask=true</code>) that I want to ask Dave B about because we aren't sure what they do, and the high res run uses a specific coupler sequence (<code>RASM_OPTION1</code>) that might actually be the 1 degree default but I need to double-check.</p>\n<p>While that run is going, I still need to generate the BGC initial condition file... but I think that'll be easy since the high res run just interpolated the tracer state from Kristen's run after 2 JRA cycles - for this run, I'll use the same output but the interpolation won't be necessary.</p>\n<p>Also, I promised <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"31\">@Keith Lindsay</span> I would point him to <code>/glade/work/mlevy/hi-res_BGC_JRA/setup_1deg_case.sh</code>, which is the script I'll run to actually configure the companion run after the physics-only JRA cycles are complete.</p>",

This would be an imperfect comparison case, for sure. </p>\n<p>The configuration details you mention are worth consideration. I am not sure, however, whether it's worth the effort at this time. Perhaps we should hold off on this step and decide once we progress with the 0.1° analyses whether to pursue running this more complete analog case.</p>",
