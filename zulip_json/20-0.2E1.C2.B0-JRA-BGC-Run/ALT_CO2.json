While we probably want the ability to disable these 2 tracers eventually, it looks to me like it is non-trivial to add such functionality to MARBL (based on a quick skim of the code). There are many lines of code scattered throughout that rely on ALT_CO2 related variables.</p>\n<p>option 1: bite the bullet and add the ability to disable these 2 tracers<br>\noption 2: pay the computational cost of running with these 2 tracers</p>\n<p>If we go with option 2, and the options for ATM_ALT_CO2 are the same as ATM_CO2, then the ALT_CO2 diagnostics will not be written out. That said, I think it is natural to ask if we can select options for ATM_ALT_CO2 that makes these 2 tracers useful. For example, would we gain anything by setting ATM_ALT_CO2 to 2xATM_CO2?</p>\n<p>So option 2 splits into</p>\n<p>option 2a: set ATM_ALT_CO2 options the same as ATM_CO2, and have no ALT_CO2 diagnostics in output<br>\noption 2b: use different ATM_ALT_CO2 options, to get some science out of these 2 tracers</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",

If some of the details turn complicated, it would probably add another day or two to work out? But I think it's contained enough that it shouldn't take more than that.</p>\n<p>Longer answer: I think the process for removing the tracers would be</p>\n<p>1. Add a new settings flag (named something like <code>alt_co2_tracers_on</code>) with default value of <code>.true.</code><br/>\n2. Modify <code>marbl_interface_private_types:tracer_index_constructor</code> to only define <code>dic_alt_co2</code> and <code>alk_alt_co2</code> if <code>alt_co2_tracers_on == .true.</code><br/>\n3. Modify <code>marbl_init_non_autotroph_tracers_metadata</code> to only define metadata if <code>alt_co2_tracers_on == .true.</code><br/>\n4. Grep for <code>dic_alt_co2_ind</code> and <code>alk_alt_co2_ind</code>, make sure the indices are only referenced if <code>alt_co2_tracers_on == .true.</code></p>\n<p>At that point, I would be tempted to just run a stand-alone test and see where else the <code>alt_co2_tracers_on == .true.</code> check needs to be made. The <code>alt_co2</code> structure bleeds into the <code>carbonate_type</code> and some surface flux types, but I think we'd be okay allocating memory for those even if we don't access them.</p>",

        "content": "<p>After talking with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"31\">@Keith Lindsay</span> , he points out that the above proposal wouldn't go very far towards disentangling the alt_co2 tracers from the base tracers. A much more extreme option would be to go so far as to make <code>alt_co2_tracers_on</code> equivalent to <code>ciso_on</code> (and creating <code>marbl_alt_co2</code> modules where computation is done), and a more realistic approach would be to keep the alt_co2 code in the same fortran modules as the base tracer computations but try to split apart the computations as much as possible to at least start on a path towards a truly separate tracer module. This starts to tie in with <a href=\"https://github.com/marbl-ecosys/MARBL/issues/154\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/marbl-ecosys/MARBL/issues/154\">https://github.com/marbl-ecosys/MARBL/issues/154</a> (MARBL issue re: modularity and making it easier to turn groups of tracers on and off).</p>\n<p>I think a less-kludgy implementation that would help us move towards a solution for #154 would take somewhere in the neighborhood of a week and a half or two weeks, and a full-fledged splitting of the fortran modules would be an additional week or so? That's just based on a cursory glance at what would be involved.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, I'll copy some of these thoughts into a MARBL issue ticket. I think github would be an appropriate place to continue discussions on possible implementation details of turning off the alt_co2 tracers, while this channel can stick to discussing what to do in the high-res run</p>",
