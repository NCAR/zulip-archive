(i) The default values for <code>ATM_NCPL</code> and <code>OCN_NCPL</code> were too small, and (ii) when I updated the <code>maint-5.6</code> -&gt; <code>master</code> merge I had a typo in the JRA -&gt; 0.1 degree runoff map file names. Those are addressed in <a href=\"https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/3515\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/3515\">https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/3515</a> but that is still in \"draft\" status until I can do more thorough testing and verify that we want the updated <code>NCPL</code> values in CIME</li>\n<li>POP: I'm working out of <a href=\"https://github.com/mnlevy1981/POP2-CESM/tree/highres_JRA_BGC\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mnlevy1981/POP2-CESM/tree/highres_JRA_BGC\">https://github.com/mnlevy1981/POP2-CESM/tree/highres_JRA_BGC</a> and I'll move that branch to <a href=\"https://github.com/ESCOMP/POP2-CESM/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ESCOMP/POP2-CESM/\">https://github.com/ESCOMP/POP2-CESM/</a> once it's a ready for a wider audience. I'm waiting on a few more forcing files, and the current issue is that MARBL is returning <code>NaN</code>s for some tracer tendencies on the first time step. Details in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/20-0.2E1.C2.B0-JRA.20BGC.20Run/topic/First.20Test.20Runs/near/7385\" title=\"#narrow/stream/20-0.2E1.C2.B0-JRA.20BGC.20Run/topic/First.20Test.20Runs/near/7385\">https://zulip2.cloud.ucar.edu/#narrow/stream/20-0.2E1.C2.B0-JRA.20BGC.20Run/topic/First.20Test.20Runs/near/7385</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"93\">@David Bailey</span> brought two of my PRs into <code>CICE</code> (thanks, Dave!), so using <a href=\"https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM_CICE5/releases/tag/cice5_20200430\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM_CICE5/releases/tag/cice5_20200430\">https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM_CICE5/releases/tag/cice5_20200430</a> will give us CICE4 physics and the necessary patches in <code>ice_import_export.F90</code> out of the box. Alper's run has a few small mods that still need to be included: (i) turning off ideal age by appending <code>-trage 0</code> to <code>CICE_CONFIG_OPTS</code>, and (ii) three namelist changes: <code>ndtd=2</code>, <code>r_snw=1.00</code>, and <code>f_blkmask = .true.</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point, I'd welcome feedback on the CIME PR: do we want the <code>NCPL</code> updates on <code>master</code>? Is there any reason to hold off and see if additional CIME changes are made, or should we get this merged ASAP and submit future PRs down the line as needed? I'm leaning towards getting it merged quickly, and then relying on <code>cesm2_2_beta05</code> as the basis for our experiment tag since that will also include our CICE mods.</p>\n<p>I haven't had a chance to really dig into why MARBL is returning those NaNs. I'll try to find some time for it next week, but would appreciate any off-the-cuff theories that would be worth investigating (read: I'm not really sure where to start digging)</p>",

One clarification -- it looks like your first diff (<code>ecosys_driver.F90</code>) was compared against a base in my directory that was already partially repaired. The original line was <code>marbl_instances(bid)%domain%delta_z(:) = DZT(i, c, :, bid)</code>, not  <code>marbl_instances(bid)%domain%delta_z(:) = DZT(i, c, 1:km, bid)</code> (I think I was starting to fix things in my base directory while we chatted, and then I forgot to revert the change when we decided you'd test the mods... so your diff picked up my patch as well). For everyone else following the thread, it turns out that the <code>k</code> index of <code>DZT</code> runs from <code>0:km+1</code>, and I had assumed it was <code>1:km</code> when updating <code>delta_z</code> in the driver. Anyway, that fix is on the POP branch and I'll look at the MARBL fix on Monday.</p>",
