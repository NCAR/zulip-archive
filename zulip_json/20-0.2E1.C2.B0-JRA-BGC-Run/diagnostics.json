You can view it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kristenkrumhardt/CESM2_oceanBGC_diag/blob/master/JRA-hires-bGC/MARBL_diagnostic_hist_x0.1JRA_004.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kristenkrumhardt/CESM2_oceanBGC_diag/blob/master/JRA-hires-bGC/MARBL_diagnostic_hist_x0.1JRA_004.ipynb\">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kristenkrumhardt/CESM2_oceanBGC_diag/blob/master/JRA-hires-bGC/MARBL_diagnostic_hist_x0.1JRA_004.ipynb</a></p>\n<p>My major concern after seeing these results is the positive bias in surface SiO3. I was hoping that the PFT-related tunings from the x1 would translate better to the x0.1. Unfortunately the diatoms really took a hit, as they are being quite outcompeted by coccos, most notably in the North Pacific. This surprises me because the North Pacific was always the last place coccos would show up when tuning in the x1. In the real world, diatoms and coccolithophores both flourish in the North Pacific. Diatoms in the Southern Ocean are also being outcompeted by small phytos in the Antarctic zone. Globally, the diatoms account for ~ 32% of NPP but this still isnâ€™t enough, as is reflected in the positive SiO3 bias at the surface (diatoms account for 38% of NPP in the x1 version). </p>\n<p>Globally integrated NPP is reasonable at 50 Pg C/yr.</p>\n<p>Globally integrated calcification is within observation boundaries.</p>\n<p>Total N fixation is within observation boundaries (yet P-limitation is still quite extensive for small phytos; I was expecting more N limitation).</p>\n<p>Global POC export is a bit low at 5.7 Pg C/yr.</p>\n<p>I made a couple summary tables comparing this run to the x1 version of CESM-cocco with JRA forcing and the OMIP run. Here is a snapshot:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/23/HUTkP3dUaI8R7L7XMMgX7Klr/summary-tables.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"summary-tables.png\">summary-tables.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/23/HUTkP3dUaI8R7L7XMMgX7Klr/summary-tables.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"summary-tables.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/23/HUTkP3dUaI8R7L7XMMgX7Klr/summary-tables.png\"></a></div><p>Please let me know if you would like to see anymore plots.</p>",
