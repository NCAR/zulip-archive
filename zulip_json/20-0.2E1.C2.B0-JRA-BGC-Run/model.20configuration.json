For the lo-res, we are not tied to an existing lo-res configuration. We are considering decreased deep Redi min so that tracer drift is more comparable to the hi-res. There is also experience with this configuration.

In that same block of logic, the value of <code>restore_inv_tau_opt</code> determines whether <code>restore_inv_tau_const</code> or <code>restore_inv_tau_input%[*]</code> gets added to well (with nothing added if no tracers are being restored).</p>\n<p>This is definitely a good short-term fix for getting an initial test up and running, but I need to think about it a little more before determining whether it should stay in the code long-term or get pulled out. The big question mark in my mind is how POP's <code>restorable_tracer_names</code> interacts with MARBL's<code>tracer_restore_vars</code>. I think they are independent, but POP will throw an error in initialization if MARBL lists a tracer in <code>tracer_restore_vars</code> that is not in POP's <code>restorable_tracer_names</code>... in which case I think it's okay to only include <code>restore_data_filenames_derived</code>, <code>restore_inv_tau_opt</code>, and either <code>restore_inv_tau_const</code> or <code>restore_inv_tau_input%[*]</code> in pop_in if <code>restorable_tracer_names</code> contains at least 1 tracer.</p>\n<p>Also, it's worth noting that the MARBL default for <code>tracer_restore_vars</code> is also empty unless we're running on the <code>x1</code> or <code>x3</code>; so at least for now no mods are required in <code>user_nl_marbl</code></p>",
