In 003, macronutrients and O2 were initialized from WOA13, DIC and ALK were initialized from GLODAPv2, and the remaining tracers were initialized from the x1 companion.</p>\n<p>One observation from the notebooks is that the histograms for <code>O2_ZMIN</code> indicate has some very large magnitude negative <code>O2</code> values in 003. I dug into this and have discovered what I think is the culprit. The bad news is that the regridding of WOA13 fields to the <code>tx0.1v3</code> grid generated all zeros in the deepest <code>tx0.1v3</code> layer. The problem is that all of the deepest model layer is deeper than the deepest WOA13 layer, and the vertical remapping function that I wrote generated zeros in this case. This problem is not present for GLODAPv2 interpolated fields. Unfortunately, I missed these bad values when inspecting the generated IC files <span aria-label=\"sad\" class=\"emoji emoji-2639\" role=\"img\" title=\"sad\">:sad:</span>. I suspect that the zero values lead to very large tracer gradients, which leads to numerical advection errors which generated the large magnitude negative <code>O2</code> values. The problem is present for all WOA13 interpolated fields: O2, PO4, NO3, SiO3. All of these tracers have spurious values near where <code>KMT</code> reaches 62. The good news is that the spurious values seem to mix out within a handful of months.</p>\n<p>While these values are definitely problematic in the first few months of 003 and are a reason to prefer 004 over 003, I'm not sure if the problem by itself is a show-stopper for 003. Given that 003 has run for a year, and our throughput, I do NOT advocate for restarting 003 with corrected IC.</p>",
