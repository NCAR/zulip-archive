<p>I am running into a problem when multiplying two data arrays. In particular, the multiplication is collapsing one of the variable dimensions. The code is a simple multiplication of two variables that are both </p>
<p>#sub_gpp: xarray.DataArray (years: 319, month: 12, pft: 64, lat: 192, lon: 288)<br>
#cropwtsmask: xarray.DataArray (years: 319, pft: 64, lat: 192, lon: 288)</p>
<p>gridded_wts    = sub_gpp * cropwtsmask</p>
<p>The 'gridded_wts' variable keeps all the dimensions the same size <em>except</em> the 'pft' dimension:<br>
gridded_wts: xarray.DataArray (years: 319, month: 12, pft: 0, lat: 192, lon: 288)</p>
<p>Any idea why this is happening and what I might be doing incorrectly? Help is very much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Danica, have you checked that your pft dimension has the same values? If you were to multiply to columns with each dimension depth:15, but one of them would have coordinates [1m, 2m, 3m..] and  the other [1.5m, 2.5m, 3.5m] it would not multiply them.</p>

<p>Thanks for this tip! I thought the dimensions were identical, but they in fact were not. Setting them equal fixed the problem!</p>
