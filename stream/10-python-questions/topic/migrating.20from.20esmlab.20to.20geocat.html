<p>I've got some old but useful code that uses <code>esmlab</code>. I noticed today that it is failing with python 3.10:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ImportError: cannot import name &#39;Mapping&#39; from &#39;collections&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>That could be fixed by changing the import statement to <code>from collections.abc import Mapping</code>, but the esmlab project has been archived , and the repo says the functionality is now in GeoCAT. </p>
<p>I'm very happy to use GeoCAT, but I'm not totally convinced that the functionality is actually there. The functions I'm using are just the weighted statistics. I know that xarray can do weighted sum/mean/std/var, but not correlation. I don't see this in GeoCAT. I can make my own weighted correlation, but it's convenient to have it in libraries I'm already importing. </p>
<p>So my question, which is probably for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13">@Anderson Banihirwe</span> and/or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="18">@Orhan Eroglu</span> and/or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="25">@Deepak Cherian</span> , is whether the recommended path is to use the Xarray weighted class to do weighted computations, and whether GeoCAT already has or plans to have additional weighted computations such as correlation?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="61">@Brian Medeiros</span> thanks a lot for bringing this to attention! Here are a few background info and suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The climatology functionalities of ESMLab have been refactored and incorporated into GeoCAT. Please see the functions under the geocat.comp.climatologies namespace in the <a href="https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_api/index.html">GeoCAT-comp User API</a>. This work was implemented by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="107">@Heather Craker</span> from GeoCAT.<br>
    - I am not sure though if you were using those basic statistics functions from ESMlab for something else or any climatology computations of your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, I find adding the weighted correlation (and other potential functions that are not Xarray's builtin functions) into GeoCAT much useful for its users. The usability of such functions was the motivation behind incorporating ESMLab functionality into GeoCAT-comp. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="107">@Heather Craker</span> , any thoughts or existing plans on this, if any? Don't worry if not; we can definitely discuss a plan for this in the GeoCAT meeting.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="18">@Orhan Eroglu</span> I personally am not working on adding weighted correlation functionality to GeoCAT while I'm still working part time; however, I can make it a priority once I start working full time in the summer. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="61">@Brian Medeiros</span> if you need the functionality sooner rather than later, I recommend opening an issue on our GeoCAT-comp repository requesting this functionality with the expected input and output. That way someone on the team can work on it they are able even if I cannot do so at the moment!</p>

<p>Hi Brian. Now that I'm back full time, I'm working on adding this functionality to GeoCAT. Currently, I'm comparing the speeds of different functions that already exists for weighted correlations. Do you have sample input and output data that I can use to run these performance tests?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="61">@Brian Medeiros</span>. If you are able to share with me the inputs and desired outputs you were getting from your function, that would help me add this functionality to GeoCAT.

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="107">@Heather Craker</span> <br>
Typically the inputs would be (latitude, longitude) arrays being correlated and the weights would be for area of grid cells (i.e., cos(latitude)). In that case, the result would be a scalar number, the correlation coefficient (possibly with auxiliary data like statistical significance). Often there could be additional dimensions, and the expected output is to reduce over the spatial dimensions. Examples would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>inputs (time, lat, lon) -&gt; output (time)</li>
<li>inputs ( lev, lat, lon) -&gt; output (lev)</li>
<li>inputs (optical_depth, cloud_top_pressure, lat, lon) -&gt; output (optical_depth, cloud_top_pressure)</li>
</ul>
<p>Does that make sense? I can provide a specific example using data on glade if that is helpful.</p>

<p>If it doesn't, then the GeoCAT team can then design something more appropriate. Once I get the example data and can more clearly see how Brian wants the xarray dimensions to be reduced/handled, then I can see if xskillscore is sufficient</p>

<p>Sorry ... got distracted with other things. Just some data to start with might be climatology files generated as part of the atmosphere diagnostics:<br>
location: <code>/glade/scratch/brianpm/cam_diag_climo/files</code><br>
There are 2 cases in that directory:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>- `b.e20.BHIST.f09_g16.20thC.125.02`
- `b.e20.BHIST.f09_g17.20thC.297_05`
</code></pre></div>

<p>That each have several variables. Examples of model-to-model correlations would be the spatial correlations of any of them. Example:<br>
<code>COR[b.e20.BHIST.f09_g16.20thC.125.02/b.e20.BHIST.f09_g16.20thC.125.02_PRECC_climo.nc, b.e20.BHIST.f09_g17.20thC.297_05/b.e20.BHIST.f09_g17.20thC.297_05_PRECC_climo.nc]</code><br>
Where the variable to be correlated is <code>PRECC</code> in each of those files. It is shaped (12, 192, 288), so I'd expect to be able to get either the total correlation by month and space (i.e., a scalar value) or an array of 12 values that give the spatial correlation for each month, depending on some kwarg like "dim".</p>

<p>I also was messing around with the weighted correlation in this notebook:<br>
<code>/glade/u/home/brianpm/Code/hacknostics/Notebooks/weighted_correlation.ipynb</code></p>
<p>My previous function has something wrong with it (but I don't know exactly what it is). The XSkillScore version seems to work correctly, and seems fast for this small problem.</p>
