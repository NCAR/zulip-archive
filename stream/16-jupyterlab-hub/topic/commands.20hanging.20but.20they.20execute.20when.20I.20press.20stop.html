<p>Hello, <br>
I've been experiencing some weird behavior on jupyterhub since the updates.  I've been finding that even fairly basic commands are hanging for ages, perhaps forever - I haven't let it get complete.  When I press the stop button, they finish executing and they appear to do it successfully.  For example, I will plot a plot, and it'll just hang there looking like it's working away for way longer than it should.  I press stop and then the plot appears.  Is anyone experiencing similar issues?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Isla</p>

<p>Just adding another issue that I'm finding since the updates.  Often when I execute cells the jupyterhub interface jumps around to some other cell such that you lose track of where you are in your code.  I know that I'm not the only one who is experiencing this particular problem since the updates.  But I'm not sure if others are experiencing the same problem as I am encountering above.</p>

<p>and it might be executing more than one cell though it does not show that it has finished executing the first cell. e.g. i am currenlty trying to load some data, I have four cells that each load one specific field. I started executing all of them, I saw the apporpriate workers on the dask panel. now it seems to be loading the data from the second cell that I am trying to execute, but it does not indicate that it is done with the first one.</p>

<p>I noticed similar behavior before the update. The cell would hang, the kernel activity/progress circle would indicate it was busy. It would slowly empty the progress circle on its own, but if I pressed the stop button, it would empty faster--one little pie piece at a time. It seemed like the more CPUs I used, the more times I had to press the stop button.</p>

<p>I'm was having similar, but not exactly the same issues with very slow dask/xarray commands after the JHub updates. For example a notebook that I ran before the update would now take 10x as long to execute, and the dask dashboard seemed to indicate tasks been executed repeatedly (or not "lazy"). This appears to be resolved with a fresh environment install, so I suspect for me it might have been the version of dask/xarray (or something else) in my old environment didn't play nicely with something about the updated JHub.</p>

<p>Hey all - it's still unclear to me why this only happens intermittently, but I have come to suspect that a particular JupyterLab extension may be causing the strange behavior with Dask when using Xarray objects. The "variableinspector" extension allows you to look at variable values in the GUI. This extension was installed before the Hub upgrade too,  but we are using a newer version that added support for Xarray.</p>
<p>Variable inspectors have been known to break lazy evaluation (e.g., PyCharm can do this...). So far in my testing turning this extension off has eliminated the problem for me, but I'd love to get some more data points before we make any global changes.</p>
<p>So if you are seeing issues with Dask notebooks, I encourage you to turn this extension off and report back your findings. You can turn it off by starting a terminal in a Hub session and running:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash"><pre><span></span><code>jupyter labextension disable --level<span class="o">=</span>user @lckr/jupyterlab_variableinspector
</code></pre></div>
<p>Extensions don't turn on/off without reloading JupyterLab, so you will then need to terminate your running server and start a new server before the extension is turned off.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience as we work though issues!</p>

<p>I'm actually noticing now that the whole page seems to freeze and/or crash when stuff like this happens</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="47">@Katie Dagon</span> I'm wondering if you pinned any packages in your environment update? I tried to update my environment and am finding that dask is either extremely slow or unresponsive with v2024.1.0 (for both xarray and dask).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="34">@Stephen Yeager</span> I didn't specify any package versions in my new environment except asking for <code>python=3.11</code>. It looks like it installed dask v2024.1.0. I didn't have any issues initially, but given <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="141">@Brian Vanderwende</span>'s comment above it might be worth checking that labextension if the issues persist.</p>

<p>However I just noticed the xarray version I have installed is 2023.12.0. It looks like I just missed the <a href="https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/whats-new.html#v2024-01-0-17-jan-2024">latest version v2024.01.0</a> which came out on Jan 17, so that could be a difference.</p>

<p>You can check <code>jupyter labextension list</code> to check if the extension is on or off.</p>

<p>Quick update - we've disabled the variableinspector extension for all users. You can still optionally enable it if you like it, but since it impacts Dask behavior when using Xarray, it wasn't tenable to keep it on by default.</p>
<p>We've also had a few users ask about disabling the LSP/linter that underlines code and adds other IDE-type behaviors. This one is more subjective so it's not clear whether it makes sense to set it off by default, but if you wish to disable it entirely, you can do so by running:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>jupyter labextension disable --level=user @jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will again require a restart of your JupyterHub server for it to take effect.</p>
