Every time I login/refresh JHub (on Cheyenne, at least) I get the following dialog:</p>

<p>I click "Build", which is invariably followed by another dialog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build Failed<br>
Build failed with 500.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing the build failure after installing an extension (or trying to include previously installed extension after updating JupyterLab) please check the extension repository for new installation instructions as many extensions migrated to the prebuilt extensions system which no longer requires rebuilding JupyterLab (but uses a different installation procedure, typically involving a package manager such as 'pip' or 'conda').</p>
<p>If you specifically intended to install a source extension, please run 'jupyter lab build' on the server for full output.</p>

<p>Hey Matt,</p>
<p>Is this happening when using stable or dev (or both)? I can't currently reproduce but I may have seen this (or a related condition) before for another user as well.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Brian</p>

<p>I am running on stable. I can imagine that it's a user specific issue.</p>

<p>In a terminal, can you get the output from "jupyter labextension list" and share with me the result (maybe via DM)?</p>

<p>Nevermind - I just see your Helpdesk ticket. I'll reply there!</p>
