<p>Yesterday I was using the text editor on JHub and the document I was working on kept jumping around, shooting up to the top as if someone hit the scroll bar (but I didn't). The platform was unusable for me due to this issue. Has anyone else experienced this?</p>

<p>I frequently experience this and would like to know why this happens. Sometimes reloading the browser fixes it without interrupting the JHub session.</p>

<p>Something similar was happening to me... not sure if it's the same thing, but if you have a find open (i.e. cmd-f), a bunch of commands operate relative to the cell your find is hovering on. So exiting the find makes this problem go away for me.</p>
