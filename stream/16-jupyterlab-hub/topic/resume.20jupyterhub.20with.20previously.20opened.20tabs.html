<p>Until recently, when I would start a jupyterhub session/server, the tabs that were open in my previous session would be restored and the file selector would show files from the directory I was previously working in. This was convenient for resuming work after logging off.</p>
<p>This behavior changed for me recently. The tabs are no longer restored and the file selector is in my home directory. I just asked another user and this is not happening for them, so it's not system wide. So I'm assuming a setting related to this got changed, perhaps by me. I have been unable to figure out how to restore the previous behavior.</p>
<p>Have others seen this change in behavior?</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to restore the previous behavior?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="31">@Keith Lindsay</span>, if I am not mistaken, jupyter uses <code>/glade/u/home/klindsay/.jupyter/lab/workspaces</code> to control this behavior.  </p>
<p>It appears that  you have a few clones of your <code>default</code> workspace that may have diverged from your default profile</p>

<p>Can you confirm that your <code>jupyterlab</code> session is using the default workspace (there shouldn't be <code>/workspaces/</code> in your jupyterlab URL)?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13">@Anderson Banihirwe</span> , thanks for taking a look...<br>
I just started a new session/server and got the URL <code>https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/user/klindsay/lab/workspaces/auto-F</code>.<br>
There is a corresponding new file in the directory <code>/glade/u/home/klindsay/.jupyter/lab/workspaces/</code>.<br>
I tried truncating the URL to <code>https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/user/klindsay/lab</code>, and it got extended with <code>workspace/auto-S</code>.</p>

<p>Try resetting the workspace by closing all <strong>jupyterlab tabs</strong>, and opening a new tab with this URL: <code>https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/user/klindsay/lab?reset</code></p>

<p>I just gave that a try and opened a tab after resetting. However, when I closed the session/server and started a new one, the tab that I had opened was not restored, and the URL that I got was <code>https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/user/klindsay/lab/workspaces/auto-j</code>.  Could I walk through this with you during office hours?</p>

<p>For future reference, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13">@Anderson Banihirwe</span> helped me track down a jupyterhub tab from an old session that was open in my browser that I didn't realize was there. This tab's presence was leading to the non-restoring behavior that I was experiencing. The restoring behavior was restored when this tab was closed. Thanks for the help <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13">@Anderson Banihirwe</span> .</p>

<p>This problem has reappeared for me since last week's HPC downtime.<br>
However, I don't see lingering jhub tabs in my browser, the previous culprit.<br>
I'm trying to determine if the reappearance is specific to my setup/settings, or if it is due to a change in the system.<br>
Are others experiencing this behavior?</p>

<p>made runtime / workspace directories ephemeral so keep them clean because they weren't keeping clean on their own and folks were ending up with thousands of socket files in their $HOME space. This may prevent a restoration as they're cleaned up at the end of jobs.</p>
