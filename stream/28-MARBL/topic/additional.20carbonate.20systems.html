<p>Hi all,<br>
I am hoping to generalise the second carbonate chemistry system to allow "N" such simultaneous systems. Looking through the MARBL code it seems to my eye that the way to go for this is to add an extra dimension to every associated variable, with N entries. Are there any existing examples in MARBL of 4d fields? Or perhaps there is a better idea of how this might be implemented?<br>
Thanks!<br>
Dafydd</p>
