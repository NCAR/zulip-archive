<p>In the latest MARBL MOM dev runs, I notice a steep increase in some BGC tracers in the Sea of Azov, a smaller sea on the north side of the Black Sea. For instance, DIC&gt;8000, ALK&gt;9000, SiO3&gt;130 after 20 years.</p>
<p>It looks like we have large riverine BGC fluxes into this region. The large fluxes are in the dataset <a href="http://riv_nut.gnews_gnm.rx1_to_tx0.66v1_nnsm_e1000r300_190315.20210405.nc">riv_nut.gnews_gnm.rx1_to_tx0.66v1_nnsm_e1000r300_190315.20210405.nc</a>, in the directory /glade/work/mlevy/cesm_inputdata.</p>
<p>They don't appear to be present in <a href="http://riv_nut.gnews_gnm.JRA025m_to_tx0.66v1_nnsm_e333r100_190910.20210401.nc">riv_nut.gnews_gnm.JRA025m_to_tx0.66v1_nnsm_e333r100_190910.20210401.nc</a>, in the same directory. I don't understand why the rx1_to_tx0.66v1 file has this feature that the JRA025m_to_tx0.66v1 doesn't have.</p>
<p>That said, the latter file seems preferable for these runs anyway, since we're using JRA forcing, which presumably has the runoff on the JRA025m grid.</p>

<p>Looking at animations of the MARBL MOM oob run, it looks like primary productivity is declining over the course of the run, particularly in the Southern and Pacific Oceans. (I have annual means of some output streams in directory /glade/scratch/klindsay/mom_oob/ocn/proc/.) The Fe limitation factors are dropping, and the other limitation terms are not. IRON_FLUX is 8 orders of magnitude smaller in MOM than in POP. I haven't dug into the code yet to see if this is a diagnostic issue, a forcing issue, or both. I'm guessing both. This is an unusual diagnostic in POP, as its output units are MKS, as opposed to most other diagnostics whose units are CGS. The field is scaled before it is passed to POP's tavg accumulate subroutine. Perhaps something is off in the translation of this to MOM.</p>

<p>You're finding bugs faster than I can fix them! :) So far</p>
<ol>
<li>I no longer create the <code>bgc_daily_z</code> stream (I had added <code>{tracer}_SURF</code> and <code>{tracer}_zint_100m</code> to the MOM output list but forgot to tell my scripts those are 2D fields</li>
<li>MOM recognizes when 2D fields have a <code>ref_depth</code> below the bottom of the column, and replaces those values with 0. I think I found the missing value variable as well, so later this morning it should appropriately mask that out</li>
</ol>
<p>Still to do (hopefully including everything mentioned above):</p>
<ol>
<li>Update which variables are written to which stream: we want <code>geolat</code> and <code>geolon</code> in every output file, and then I should pare down the additional variables that are added to streams with 3D variables (<code>volcelo</code> might be the only required field?) For 3D fields written on the native grid, I plan to include <code>h</code> as well to make it a little easier to reconstruct depth. Should I also include <code>ocn_depth</code> so we don't force the topmost interface to be 0? This would basically let us reconstruct <code>SSH</code> by summing <code>h</code> and subtracting the bathymetry.</li>
<li>Switch river nutrients to the file mapped from <code>JRA025m</code> instead of <code>rx1</code></li>
<li>Look into how <code>IRON_FLUX</code> is accumulated, and make sure MOM isn't trying to apply any unit conversion since it's already in mks</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the tracers, biomass and non-refractory DOM,  in the MARBL MOM dev runs are negative. With MOM's numerics we should be able to avoid this. In this case, it looks like the negative values are in the initial condition file, which for these tracers looks like it was regridded from the spunup CESM2 IC. In POP, when we read tracer values from a non-restart file, we set negative values to 0. I suggest we also do that in the MOM MARBL driver, after <a href="https://github.com/NCAR/MOM6/blob/7a28f8bb8c6b1f043e63b46c704d9dae7c5978ae/src/tracer/MARBL_tracers.F90#L605-L608">these lines</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the MARBL MOM t061 IC, there are numerical artifacts close to topographic features in the tracers that were regridded from the POP grid to the MOM grid. For instance, there are isolated zeros around the northern coastline of Canada.</p>
<p>Did the regridding of these variables normalize the result if the source grid only partially covered the destination grid?</p>
<p>We might also need to apply a fill algorithm to get values set where the regridding doesn't get the job done.</p>
<p>I recall Frank updating a regrid/fill algorithm to take care of such concerns, and be fast, but I don't remember which repo it was in. It might have been pop_tools.</p>

<p>I think I fixed both issues with <code>IRON_FLUX</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="31">@Keith Lindsay</span> pointed out, I was missing a few terms in the computation but I added them in</li>
<li>The units were also wrong -- MOM is storing values from the coupler in <code>kg / m^2 / s</code> but MARBL wants input in <code>nmol / cm^2 / s</code> so  need to multiply by 1e8 / <code>molw_Fe</code>, or roughly 1.8e6</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the output from the model now, POP's <code>IRON_FLUX</code> from Jan 0001 has a range of (5e-14, 7e-8) while MOM is (1e-13, 3e-9). (MARBL does one last conversion, so this output has units of <code>mmol / m^2 / s</code> in the history files). I was a little surprised that MOM's max value was 1/20th the size of POP's max value, but does that seem like a reasonable change given differences in the grids, numerics, etc between the models?</p>

<p>Peak values for atm dep usually occur along the coastline. Since these grids are different resolution, one grid might pick up an extreme coastal value that the other grid is missing. So looking at the range is tricky to interpret.</p>
<p>I suggest choosing an open ocean feature, .e.g, for IRON_FLUX, the low values along the equator in the Pacific, and use the mouse to determine typical values in the vicinity of the region on both grids. If those roughly agree then things are looking up.</p>

<p>Found it - I was converting from mks -&gt; cgs twice... I think this will improve both <code>IRON_FLUX</code> and <code>DUST_FLUX</code>, which might also have been off by a factor of 10</p>

<p>Looking at the MARBL MOM t061 IC, there are numerical artifacts close to topographic features in the tracers that were regridded from the POP grid to the MOM grid. For instance, there are isolated zeros around the northern coastline of Canada.</p>
<p>Did the regridding of these variables normalize the result if the source grid only partially covered the destination grid?</p>
<p>We might also need to apply a fill algorithm to get values set where the regridding doesn't get the job done.</p>
<p>I recall Frank updating a regrid/fill algorithm to take care of such concerns, and be fast, but I don't remember which repo it was in. It might have been pop_tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notebook that generated these initial conditions is <a href="https://github.com/mnlevy1981/marbl-forcing/blob/MOM_ic/initial_conditions/gen_mom6_omip_IC.ipynb">here</a>... and looking closer, there is definitely some unexpected 0s in the fields mapped from POP. <code>DOPr</code> was the easiest for me to see, since most of the values are all pretty far from 0 in that field so the small values really stand out:</p>

<p>Looking closer at the plots in the notebook, it seems like maybe we aren't constructing the POP values correctly -- instead of missing values, land has 0s? That would explain why the WOA data mapped over better. If that's the case, masking out the continents before doing the POP -&gt; MOM map should improve the look of things</p>

<p>I ended up using <code>pop_tools.get_grid()</code> to get POP's <code>REGION_MASK</code> and then using that to mask out the POP data... the <code>DOPr</code> field looks promising -- note that the color bar starts around 0.02 instead of right at 0. We already had calls to lateral and vertical fill routines, but I don't think they were doing anything because the source grid was happily mapping 0s from land rather than letting missing values propogate / get filled in later.</p>

<p>I restarted <code>mom_hybrid_z</code> and created <code>mom_oob.002</code> last night, both built with the latest code documented above and started with regenerated initial conditions. The hybrid case is on the big pe layout, so it should be finishing 4 years every 10 hours or so; the out-of-the-box run is on the old layout, so it’s running in 2-year chunks. I’m going to be out-of-touch until Monday night, but hopefully when I’m back in the office on Tuesday things look okay :)</p>

<p>I think I've got <code>FESEDFLUX</code> plumbed in correctly (thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="31">@Keith Lindsay</span> for all the help). There were two big things going wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li>After reading in <code>FESEDFLUX</code> from disk, I was trying to accumulate all the flux from below the ocean floor into the layer containing <code>bathyT</code>... but it turned out that when <code>bathyT</code> was exactly equal to a layer interface depth on the forcing grid, it would accumulate into the layer below <code>bathyT</code> instead of above it. So we were losing all the sub-floor flux in many columns</li>
<li>Keith pointed out that <code>FESEDFLUX</code> is the only diagnostic we have where we want to conserve the column sum when vertically interpolating. It turns out that there is a specific flag to use when registering a diagnostics (<code>v_extensive = .true.</code>) to conserve the column sum when remapping from the model vertical to whatever grid is being used when writing history files.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also had a bug in my notebook that compares the column sums: I was writing the MOM output to a history file that used the POP vertical levels to make it easy to compare the input and output files. However, the MOM output has missing values below <code>bathyT</code> while the forcing file has full columns at every ocean cell (I believe the forcing file that was mapped from the POP horizontal to the MOM horizontal has 0s below <code>KMT</code>).</p>
<p>Lastly, I added a step to the generation of the forcing file. I now apply the POP land mask to the source file, and then use <code>pop-tools</code> to laterally fill the land before mapping to MOM (and the POP -&gt; MOM mapping file does not know about the POP land mask). I had noticed some weird patterns of 0s in the MOM forcing file that I traced to areas of the globe that are land in POP but open ocean in MOM (e.g. between Australia and Papua New Guinea) and this seemed like a reasonable way to avoid those patterns.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think everything is resolved now and I've launched <code>mom_oob.003</code> and <code>mom_hybrid_z.003</code> with these updates. <span aria-label="fingers crossed" class="emoji emoji-1f91e" role="img" title="fingers crossed">:fingers_crossed:</span></p>

<p>Also, using 81 nodes per run (79 for POP, 1 for CICE, 1 for everyone else), I'm seeing ~10.5 SYPD for the oob run. That layout was good for ~9 with the hybrid grid, so both of these runs should be complete over the weekend...</p>

<p>FYI I just restarted both runs around 3:00 today... so they should both still finish over the weekend but now there will be a stream file with output using the POP vertical levels (-ish). Still expect them to finish tomorrow or Sunday, to be looked at Monday morning</p>
