<p>Hi all! John will join us for our next OWG meeting to give us the rundown on the NCAR EdEC recommendations, I will send him an invite. This is currently scheduled for <strong>Tues Aug 30 at 9 am MDT</strong> as usual. With the new IWG/EWG schedule, this means it won't be until after two <em>more</em> meetings including the entire next EWG meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we consider bumping up our OWG meetings a week (so that we have something to report to EWG in a consistent and timely way) or totally changing our meeting day/timeslot?</li>
<li>Also a nudge for us to iron out our AMS abstract responsibilities asynchronously this week and next regardless, since those abstracts are due end-ish of next week.</li>
</ul>
