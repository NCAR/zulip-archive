<p>Hi all, I'm passing on this message from Daniel Howard about a training that could be of interest:</p>
<p>I would like to invite NCAR staff that offer user support to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhlvuNk1RB3RGUdCMMyXQ3QPwZC8phNLzmWStgSl7HM/edit">CyberFascilitation: Communications Training</a> hybrid event <strong>Mon. July 31st from 1-5pm at the Mesa Lab, Damon Room or virtual</strong>. This takes place during the Cheyenne outage scheduled at this time. I believe your group and colleagues would benefit from this given the office hours and ESDS support you coordinate.</p>
<p>This training is part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/cyberambassadors/home">CyberAmbassadors program</a> and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1730137&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Award #1730137</a>. Having participated in their program as a certified trainer, I plan to offer the communications module for peers and colleagues at NCAR.</p>
<p>Please forward this opportunity with your team as well as any others who might be interested. Please use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zUTEj6TyMAOY20b4E6C9ThT8E0VWPEx3xzIoStrLpMM/edit">registration form</a> to confirm attendance to the event or refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhlvuNk1RB3RGUdCMMyXQ3QPwZC8phNLzmWStgSl7HM/edit">informational flyer here</a>.</p>
