<p>I am trying to spin up a dask cluster with 72 workers, and when the machine gets busy it can take a lot of time for all the workers to be ready at once... so several workers may sit idle for a while (and, in extreme cases, the first workers to get launched may run out of walltime before the rest of the cluster is available).</p>
<p>I'm currently running</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Python"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">cluster</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PBSCluster</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">memory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'20 GB'</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="n">log_directory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'./dask-logs'</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="n">client</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>so I get 72 jobs, each requesting a single core and being treated as a single worker. Is there a way to have <code>cluster.scale()</code> submit a single job request? If I were to blindly change things, I would try</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Python"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">cluster</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PBSCluster</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">memory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'1440 GB'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">processes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">72</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">cores</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">72</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">queue</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'casper'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">walltime</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'1:30:00'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">resource_spec</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'select=72:ncpus=1:mem=20GB'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">log_directory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'./dask-logs'</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">cluster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">scale</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Client</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cluster</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">client</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>but I'm pretty confused about the interaction between dask and PB. I want to avoid a situation where I request 72 cores and dask treats that as a single worker.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10">@Michael Levy</span> Have you seen <a href="https://github.com/NCAR/dask-tutorial/blob/main/notebooks/05-dask-hpc.ipynb">this notebook</a> from the dask tutorial led by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="71">@Negin Sobhani</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="141">@Brian Vanderwende</span> this past spring? I found it to be a very helpful resource for understanding PBS and dask. I'm not sure if it answers your exact question though. Maybe tweaking the <code>resource_spec</code> relative to the <code>cores</code>parameter? Could <a href="https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/how-to/adaptive.html">adaptive scaling</a> be useful here?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="47">@Katie Dagon</span> ! I hadn't seen that notebook, but I'll read through it and follow some of the links. I think my use-case is different from most, though, so I'd like to stay away from adaptive scaling. While typical scripts can start running with a few workers and then scale up, I'd really like to make sure we have all the memory / cores we requested before doing any computation - and if we're going to wait for all of the workers to be available, it makes sense to let PBS treat it as a single job request instead of running one worker at a time as the resources become available.</p>
