<p>I'm using dask to parallelize some independent function calls on Cheyenne.  I call client.submit(fnc,*args) in a for loop.  When the length of the loop, and therefore number of submissions, exceeds the number of workers I get several errors stating:<br>
distributed.nanny - WARNING - Restarting worker<br>
and most (though not all) of the jobs fail.  </p>
<p>I don't think I have this issue on my local machine .  I'm just using dask to leverage the multiple cores on a single Cheyenne node (not working across multiple PBS job submissions or nodes).   Is there something that needs to be setup on the client or scheduler so I can have a queue for the workers?  Does a dask distributed client not have the ability to queue jobs?</p>
