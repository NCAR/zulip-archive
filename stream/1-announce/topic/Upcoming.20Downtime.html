<p>Dear Zulip Users,</p>
<p>The NWSC Datacenter (which is where the Zulip server is located) will be <strong>completely down from 7/26 to 7/28</strong> for maintenance to the power infrastructure.  During that time, this Zulip service will also be unavailable.</p>
<p>I will try to keep you all informed and reminded as the date approaches.</p>

<p>The Zulip server and service have been upgraded. The upgrades were successful, however the efforts to fix the search functionality were unsuccessful. We're looking into migrating the service to a new server and OS in the near future to try to address this problem again. This will involve a number  of meticulous steps including migrating the database. and require a bit more coordination. A message will be sent when a solidified plan is determined.</p>
