<p>Hey all! The <a href="https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2024">2024 Improving Scientific Software Conference</a> (organized by the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly) will be held in April at Center Green and virtually. It will focus on the modernization of scientific software, and what that means to the community now and in the years to come. </p>
<p>The conference is for staff and students at research institutions, universities, and industry who are interested in the latest developments in scientific software.  <strong>Abstracts for talks and tutorials will be accepted until January 26, 2024.</strong></p>
<p>We welcome any submissions that touch on the challenges and opportunities of modernizing software code, workflows, development, and more.  We are also trying out Jupyter Notebooks as the proceeding type for interested submitters this year, and I'm excited to see how that turns out! For potential submissions topics and the abstract submission form, visit <a href="https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2024">the conference website</a>.</p>
