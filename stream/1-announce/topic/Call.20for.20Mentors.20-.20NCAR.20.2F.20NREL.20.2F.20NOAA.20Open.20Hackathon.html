<p>The <a href="https://www.openhackathons.org/s/siteevent/a0CUP00000rwYYZ2A2/se000355">Open Hackathon</a> is a month away, to be held hybrid Feb 25-27 in Golden, CO, with virtual intro days on the 12th and 18th! <strong>If you’re interested in participating as a mentor for any of the teams (even non-NCAR to expose yourself to systems at other labs), please fill in your info and rank teams of interest on the 2nd tab mentor page of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sLdj6ph1BuPhsRgwIw9sSp3G_RBfTVqScQQx6-sopis/edit?gid=0#gid=0">tracker sheet</a> for accepted teams.</strong> Both software and systems folks are welcome as per their interest. <em>As for time commitment, mentors are encouraged to be engaged during the full event days, especially 25-27th, but consultant level, part time support is welcome as well depending on your schedule.</em></p>
<p>The NCAR teams are as follows but you are welcome to support teams from NREL, NOAA, or the one Yale team using Julia.<br>
Turbulence and Energy Systems Laboratory (CU Boulder team using NCAR-LES)<br>
Xarray on GPUs (NCAR, Negin, et al)<br>
MILES and CREDIT application (NCAR, DJ Gagne, et al)</p>
<p>Folks who may participate as a junior mentor alongside a more experienced mentor if preferred. All levels of support and experience is welcome. Collaborations with teams are expected only during the hackathon but may extend past the event given mutual agreement of team members.</p>
