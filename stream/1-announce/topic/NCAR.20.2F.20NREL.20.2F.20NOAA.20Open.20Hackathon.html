<p><strong>The <a href="https://www.openhackathons.org/s/siteevent/a0CUP00000rwYYZ2A2/se000355">NOAA / NCAR / NREL Open Hackathon</a> scheduled end of Feb. 2025 will have applications extended until Dec 10th.</strong> These events are intended to support science teams to make progress on and accelerate their research software by pairing teams with computational scientists and research software engineers across the community, including mentors from other national labs and NVIDIA. <strong>Perhaps this could be an extension of work planned at the <a href="https://lu.ma/8mj6f3qn">post-AGU Pangeo Hack Day</a>?</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in participating, please reach out. The application is relatively straight forward but happy to work with you to identify potential teammates/partners to participate in the event together for your project. If you require an extension, please let me know as well.</p>
