<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>If you were at the ESDS Forum yesterday, you'll recall that I mentioned a new way of <span class="user-group-mention" data-user-group-id="6">@hpcd</span> supporting the R language: Conda environments. This is part of slate of new software installs and kernels we've added to the login and JupyterHub environments today. Here is a quick rundown:</p>
<p><strong>NPL 2023a</strong> - New NCAR Package Library conda environment and Jupyter kernel. We've moved to Python 3.9 with this install.<br>
<strong>R 4.2</strong> - New conda-based install of R plus a pre-installed collection of packages. Accessible via conda (not environment modules).<br>
<strong>Matlab R2022b</strong> - The latest Matlab version now has a JupyterHub language kernel.</p>
<p>As mentioned yesterday, the big change is using Conda to curate our R package library instead of source installs. I've installed packages that I know get used by our R users, but if you use R and would like to see other packages included, please let me know. The big benefit here should be more robust R libraries, and easier methods for users to augment with their own. The "r" channel has been added to the list of default channels below conda-forge, to increase the scope of what is available when running conda search.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the next thing on my agenda is to do some cleanup of old kernels in the JupyterHub. Later this week, I'll share a list of kernels we plan to remove and solicit your feedback.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements to our process that could better help you in doing science. Thanks!</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Brian</p>
