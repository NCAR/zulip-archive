<p>Starting tomorrow, our Zulip instance will no longer have unlimited free access to Zulip’s Mobile Push Notification Service. We are in continued communication with Zulip to address this and are also looking into other chat options due to the restructuring of Zulip's software plans and policies.<br>
We are also aware of the broken search functionality since the last upgrade. We are trying to address it and unfortunately the broken capability may be outside and beyond any effort we are able to try. Please stay tuned and we appreciate your patience.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting us know <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309">@Nick Wehrheim</span> . I was wondering who is the zulip space admin? I realized many capabilities (e.g. editing a stream that I created) is not available for normal users and I was not sure who is the admin I could reach out to.</p>

<p>Hi Negin! Myself, Ken Cote and Chris Zavala maintain the service and updates and there are other admins such as Julia Kent, Katelyn Fitzgerald, Matt Long and Thomas Hauser who help admin the space(s). If there is ever a question or concern about the service, please utilize <a href="mailto:help@ucar.edu">help@ucar.edu</a> and we can escalate from there.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="*">@all</span> ,</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the ESDS Forum last week we will be making a transition from this Zulip instance to a Slack workspace in the near future.  We’ll be sharing more details and invitations soon, but in the meantime I wanted to share some information regarding timelines and archives and give folks the opportunity to raise any questions or concerns.  </p>
<p>In terms of timelines, Zulip will continue to be available through May 16, 2025 at which point it will go read-only and be decommissioned shortly thereafter.  Public streams will be archived and available here: <a href="https://ncar.github.io/zulip-archive/">https://ncar.github.io/zulip-archive/</a>.  However, data from <em>private streams and direct messages will not be archived</em> so we encourage you to transfer any information that might be needed from those as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You can expect invitations to the Slack workspace sometime late this week and we’ll be looking for feedback from folks regarding how to make that space work best for our community.  </p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns you can reach out to me via DM or email.</p>

<p>Hi @all,</p>
<p>The time has come to make the switch over to Slack!  </p>
<p>As mentioned today in Daily Bulletin and our ESDS Forum announcements, we'll be joining the NCAR HPC User Group (NHUG) and other CISL supported community efforts in the existing NHUG Slack workspace soon to be renamed the NCAR Compute and Data Commons (NCDC).</p>
<p>If you are not already a member of the NCAR HPC User Group (NHUG) Slack workspace you can join via <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/ncarhpcusergroup/shared_invite/zt-3427n89dh-27_tGO3k6QiPCluMqzF0jA">this invite link</a> to be added to the ESDS channels by default.</p>
<p>If you've already joined the NHUG Slack space, please consider joining the #esds-community and #python-users channels to stay engaged with the ESDS community.</p>
<p>You can find the announcement regarding the renaming of the workspace <a href="https://arc.ucar.edu/articles/851">here in today's CISL Daily Bulletin</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the NCAR-UCAR Zulip instance will go read-only as of May 16, 2025 and be fully decommissioned on May 30, 2025.  Public streams will be archived here: <a href="https://ncar.github.io/zulip-archive/">https://ncar.github.io/zulip-archive/</a></p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just a quick update that the name for the Slack workspace we're moving to was changed to the NCAR Compute and Data Commons (NCDC) last night.</p>
<p>It sounds like there may also be some challenges associated with making this space "read-only."  We're working on an updated plan, but the overall transition timeline should still be the same.</p>
<p>And here's the invitation link for the Slack workspace for those who may have missed it:<br>
<strong><a href="http://NCAR%20Compute%20and%20Data%20Commons%20(NCDC)">ESDS invite link to the Slack workspace</a></strong></p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="*">@all</span>,</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder that this workspace will have decreased functionality as of tomorrow and be shutting down on May 30, 2025.</p>
