<p>Starting tomorrow, our Zulip instance will no longer have unlimited free access to Zulip’s Mobile Push Notification Service. We are in continued communication with Zulip to address this and are also looking into other chat options due to the restructuring of Zulip's software plans and policies.<br>
We are also aware of the broken search functionality since the last upgrade. We are trying to address it and unfortunately the broken capability may be outside and beyond any effort we are able to try. Please stay tuned and we appreciate your patience.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting us know <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309">@Nick Wehrheim</span> . I was wondering who is the zulip space admin? I realized many capabilities (e.g. editing a stream that I created) is not available for normal users and I was not sure who is the admin I could reach out to.</p>

<p>Hi Negin! Myself, Ken Cote and Chris Zavala maintain the service and updates and there are other admins such as Julia Kent, Katelyn Fitzgerald, Matt Long and Thomas Hauser who help admin the space(s). If there is ever a question or concern about the service, please utilize <a href="mailto:help@ucar.edu">help@ucar.edu</a> and we can escalate from there.</p>
