<p>UCAR/NCAR is spinning up an organization-wide mentoring program and we're looking for applications for volunteers to serve on the steering committee we'll be setting up.</p>
<p>We're hoping to get representation from across all job categories across the organization.  We're looking for representation in each of the following job categories:<br>
3 scientists (one at each level - early, mid, late)<br>
software engineer<br>
it/system administrator<br>
administrative assistant<br>
2 more slot to be filled by the other job categories throughout the organization</p>
<p>These 8 members  will be responsible for recruiting participants and in helping select and match mentors/mentees.  Commitment will be about 30 hours per year, which will be chargeable to a specific account.</p>
<p>Please consider filling out the application if you're interested in serving on this committee.  <br>
