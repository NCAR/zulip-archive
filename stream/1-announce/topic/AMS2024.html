<p>Hi All,<br>
I'm reaching out to see if you or someone that you could recommend would be interested in volunteering or showcasing a resource at the American Meteorological Society open science and data help desk during the AMS annual meeting Jan 29 - Feb 1 in Baltimore MD? If so, enter your name, affiliation and email in one of the available slots found on the attached spreadsheet and also indicate if you'd like to simply staff the help desk, or also showcase a resource. Please use the following structure to enter this information:<br>
"Name/Affiliation/email/HelpDesk or Showcase -Resource being showcased"</p>
<p>A large monitor will be provided to support showcases.</p>
<p>We'd prefer to fill up the color shaded slots first, but feel free to choose any open time.<br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUDGn41_mi_ol8F6a3k1sdXjCxvEe2Rrgfx8TZUDXZQ/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUDGn41_mi_ol8F6a3k1sdXjCxvEe2Rrgfx8TZUDXZQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>Volunteer expectations are fairly simple as described <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19M1hWQ1bVZ7hJDR1nqcVB9UHqk986MPyDVNGKPSNQhU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. For showcases, we don't expect a formal presentation, but it would be good to either have a few slides available that can describe your resource and can rotate and/or a web based resource that you can present to interested parties. Also, we suggest recruiting colleagues to stop by the desk when you're staffing or showcasing a resource at the help desk (e.g. flash mob to draw others in), and bring swag to hand out if possible.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your consideration, and please let me know if you have any questions.<br>
Doug</p>
