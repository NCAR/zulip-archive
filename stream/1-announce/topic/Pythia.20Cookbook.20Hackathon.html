<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>The Project Pythia community will be holding a "cookbook" hackathon next week (M-W), and we could probably use some more ideas on cookbooks that the NCAR science community would like to see. What is a cookbook you might ask? We're still trying to nail down the definition ourselves,  but essentially it is a Jupyter Notebook based workflow that illustrates how to solve a science problem using the Scientific Python Ecosystem. For an example, see this  <a href="https://projectpythia.org/cookbook-gallery.html">radar cookbook</a>.  </p>
<p>If you have an idea for a workflow that you'd like to see,  and you can provide a "good" description of it, or if you have an existing workflow that you think could be polished up and turned into a cookbook that might benefit others, please consider suggesting it by opening a GitHub issue <a href="http://url">here</a>. Though we can't guarantee that we'll get to your particular cookbook next week, we'll have software developers on hand eager to work on interesting problems. </p>
<p>Cheers - jc</p>
