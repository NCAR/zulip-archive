<p>I want to add a new stream (on git) to zulip. I see how to do it but I don't kow if I should copy all subscribers from other streams or let people self-select.  The former could be obnoxious, the latter not very effective in getting my question answered. Any advice?</p>

<p>You could post the new stream in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="1" href="/#narrow/stream/1-announce">#announce</a> and/or <a class="stream" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-general">#general</a> to advertise. Also, I think it’s fine to subscribe all and let people unsubscribe.</p>
