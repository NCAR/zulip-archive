<p>Is there a policy for inviting collaborators to zulip?  I'd like to send an invite to Phil Rasch from PNNL in reference to a zarr/ LENS dataset question he has that I can't answer, but don't want to overstep. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I don't know that there's an official policy, but I believe the norm has been to allow external collaborators, students, and NCAR/UCAR alums so long as it's a good fit and relevant.</p>

<p>Agreed, we definitely have external collaborators on here and I think that's great.</p>
