<p>Multiple Postdoctoral Positions are available at the interface of climate science and data science at Columbia University, the University of California Irvine, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The recently awarded 2021 National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP, <a href="https://leap.columbia.edu/">https://leap.columbia.edu/</a>) aims to develop next-generation climate modeling by developing and applying modern data science algorithms to climate science. LEAP is a joint effort between Columbia University, the University of California Irvine, New York University, The University of Minnesota, Teachers College, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), and NCAR. The hired postdocs and engineer will be part of a burgeoning transdisciplinary team at the interface between machine learning/data science and climate sciences, including research scientists, faculty members, PhD students, undergraduate and Bridge-to-PhD researchers. </p>

<p>One of the primary goals of LEAP is to increase the diversity in geosciences and data science, to be on par with the US population by the end of the Center lifetime. The Center will take proactive steps to reach its diversity goal. We thus particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>First review of applications will start on May 13, 2022. Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled.</p>
<p>Applicants should apply to their specific position of interest but are welcome to apply to multiple positions.</p>
