<p>If you are installing the latest version of tensorflow (2.15) on casper or derecho and want GPU support, I recommend using the following command, which will install both tensorflow and the cuda toolkit and cudnn compiled with that version of tensorflow:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you are on a GPU node, run the following command to verify that the GPUs can be detected:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>python3 -c &quot;import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices(&#39;GPU&#39;))&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to use keras 3 with the latest version of tensorflow, you will need to run pip install keras separately since tensorflow is still installing keras 2. That should change whenever tensorflow 2.16 comes out. </p>
<p>The latest version of tensorflow also has fixed the numpy versioning issue, so you should no longer need to pin your numpy to less than 1.24.</p>
