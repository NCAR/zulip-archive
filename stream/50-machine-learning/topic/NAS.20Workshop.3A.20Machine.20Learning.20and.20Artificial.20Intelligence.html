Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Advance Earth System Science: Opportunities and Challenges – A Workshop<br>
February 7, 10, 11, 2022 | 1:00-4:00 pm (All times ET)</p>
<p>Earth system science explores interactions among natural and social processes that affect Earth’s capacity for sustaining life. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) have the potential to advance Earth system science understanding, analysis, modeling, prediction, and decision making.</p>
<p>This three-day workshop will bring together Earth system science experts, machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers, social and behavioral scientists, ethicists, and decision-makers across sectors to explore opportunities and challenges, including the ethical development and use, of using ML/AI to advance Earth system science. Workshop discussions will examine state-of-the-art approaches for using ML/AI for Earth system science, consider challenges and ways to mitigate risks of using ML/AI, and identify future opportunities to accelerate progress.
