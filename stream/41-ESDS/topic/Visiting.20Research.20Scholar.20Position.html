<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just wanted to let everyone be aware of the following opportunity to work with the Chapel Team at HPE/Cray to evaluate the use of the language for numerical simulation and/or large-scale data analysis projects. <br>
<a href="https://hpe.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/Jobsathpe/job/Seattle-Washington-United-States-of-America/Visiting-Scholar-for-Chapel-Programming-Language-Team_1123949">https://hpe.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/Jobsathpe/job/Seattle-Washington-United-States-of-America/Visiting-Scholar-for-Chapel-Programming-Language-Team_1123949</a></p>
<p>**Job Description:   <br>
**HPE is seeking a scientist who uses computational methods to analyze data, write simulations, or otherwise augment their science to join the Chapel development team for a year. Chapel (<a href="http://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) is an open-source programming language that improves the productivity of scientists and engineers by enabling them to write efficient and concise parallel programs that run on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers.  This visiting scientist will have the opportunity (and support of the Chapel engineers) to explore how the Chapel programming language might solve some of the computational challenges they face, including performance for multi-node parallel codes, code readability, and programming structure.  This collaboration will provide the scientist an opportunity provide direct feedback that will be used to shape future Chapel development.<br>
The Chapel programming language is written to be easy to write code in like Python, but also provides parallel computation abstractions for taking advantage of multi-core parallelism, distributed parallelism across nodes in a cluster or supercomputer, and GPU parallelism.  Some sample applications written in Chapel are the open-source, data analytics package Arkouda (<a href="https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda">https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda</a>) and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver called CHAMPS (<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/papers/Scitech_2021_CHAMPS_presentation.pdf">https://chapel-lang.org/papers/Scitech_2021_CHAMPS_presentation.pdf</a>).<br>
The Chapel team (<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/contributors.html">https://chapel-lang.org/contributors.html</a>) works remotely across the four continental US time zones.  Relocation to Seattle, where the team has office space, is possible.  The salary range for this one-year position is $120K to $150K.  We encourage applications from scientists who develop or maintain open-source software used in their research community (faculty going on sabbatical or research leave might also be interested).  The scientist will be expected to collaborate, develop software, and potentially publish with Chapel team members (the team includes five PhDs in Computer Science and four Masters degrees). Any questions about the position can be sent to <a href="mailto:michelle.strout@hpe.com">michelle.strout@hpe.com</a>.</p>
<p>Responsibilities:<br>
•    Prototype aspects of a scientific software pipeline in Chapel<br>
•    Interact with the Chapel team through at least one weekly meeting<br>
•    Develop and present tutorials about using Chapel for their scientific community<br>
Education, Skills, and Experience Required:<br>
•    At least 2 years of experience doing software development.<br>
•    A Masters or PhD in some field of research<br>
•    Publications in that field of research<br>
•    Experience writing and maintaining software for use in that field of research<br>
•    Experience in working with others on cooperative projects<br>
•    Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills<br>
•    Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English<br>
Ideal candidates will have experience with one or more of the following topics:<br>
•    developing applications to run in a high-performance computing environment<br>
•    parallel computing on supercomputers, clouds, laptops, or GPUs<br>
•    library development for scientific computing, data science, or AI/machine learning</p>
