<p><em>From the <a href="https://github.com/LinkedEarth">LinkedEarth</a> team:</em><br>
We are pleased to announce a new training opportunity for geoscientists, <a href="https://medium.com/cyberpaleo/new-training-opportunities-frogs-facilitating-reproducible-open-geoscience-1f12b857ec21">FROGS</a>. The training will consist of asynchronous materials and a series of workshops to learn about geoscience practice and the publishing of research products following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. Our first workshop will take place this summer (June 3-6) in Marina Del Rey, CA and is intended for audiences wanting to learn scientific programming in Python and R, to deepen their knowledge of geoscientific time series analysis and to learn how to publish their research (data, code, workflows) to ensure that results are reproducible. More information about this training can be found <a href="http://linked.earth/FROGS/">here</a> along with the application form.</p>
<p>Researchers engaged in any geoscience fields and at any career level are welcome to apply. Priority will be given to early-career scientists and scientists from underrepresented groups in the geosciences (e.g., women, underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students). Thanks to National Science Foundation funding, we will provide  travel reimbursement (up to $2000/participant) for participants at US-based institutions.</p>
<p>Applications are due March 15th 2024.</p>
