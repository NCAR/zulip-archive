<p>Passing along this conference opportunity from Radiant Earth Foundation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help shape the upcoming <a href="https://2025-ut.cloudnativegeo.org/">Cloud-Native Geospatial (CNG) Forum Conference 2025</a>, taking place April 30-May 2 in Snowbird, Utah. We’re currently looking for speakers. If you’ve got an idea, project, or innovation you’re passionate about, we’d love for you to submit a talk.</p>
<p>Here are the three tracks to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On-ramp to Cloud-Native Geospatial Data: Helping professionals new to cloud-native workflows get started. This is geared towards people who are getting started with cloud-native geo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud-Native Geospatial in Practice: Real-world applications, cost-saving strategies, and community innovations. Perfect for practitioners and those familiar with cloud-native geospatial tech. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bridge Between Science and Technology: Bridging the gap between scientific advances and scalable, real-world solutions. For executives and those interested in policy. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit your talk proposal here: <a href="https://events.cloudnativegeo.org/cng2025-presentations">https://events.cloudnativegeo.org/cng2025-presentations</a></p>
<p>One thing we’re actively working on is creating a more inclusive speaker lineup. Right now, we have incredible talks lined up, but we’re seeing the same voices that often dominate geospatial conferences. We’d love your help in changing that.  If you know individuals or groups whose perspectives can enrich our conversation, please share your recommendations! </p>
