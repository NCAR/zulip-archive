<p>CISL is in the process of standing up a research prototype hybrid Cloud with the intent of using the experience to guide the deployment of a production cloud computing resource in the future. We are currently identifying use cases to help configure the resource, and evaluate the system once operational. Example use cases might include: interactive, web based visualization;  a BinderHub service; or accessing and processing data from object storage. If you have a scientific workflow that you think might benefit from an on-premise Cloud,  and you are willing to work with CISL staff to define requirements and assist in evaluation, we'd love to hear from you. Please contact John Clyne (<a href="mailto:clyne@ucar.edu">clyne@ucar.edu</a>).  Or, if you have an unformed idea, consider posting it here and allowing the community to help refine it.</p>
