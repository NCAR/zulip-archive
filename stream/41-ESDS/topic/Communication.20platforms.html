<p>@all, I would like to propose that we move some of our more substantive conversations to <br>
<a href="https://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu/" target="_blank" title="https://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu/">https://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu/</a></p>
<p>This forum is currently semi-open; it requires creating an account and logging in to view posts. I would like to remove this restriction shortly, however, enabling viewing without logging in.</p>
<p>This platform enables us to reach a wider audience through out discussion. As we learn, the content of discussion will grow in depth. In this way, we can provide leadership, entrain collaborators, and more effectively dovetail with other communities. </p>
<p>A note on the history: Shortly after setting up <a href="http://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu" target="_blank" title="http://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu">discourse-nsa.ucar.edu</a>, I requested <a href="http://discource.ucar.edu" target="_blank" title="http://discource.ucar.edu">discource.ucar.edu</a>, realizing that the scope is broader than the NSA. NCAR/UCAR administration shut that down, preferring that Sundog serve as the default discussion platform. This precludes external engagement, however, which I think it important—this argument swayed them into allowing <a href="http://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu" target="_blank" title="http://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu">discourse-nsa.ucar.edu</a>. </p>
<p>I don't think we should think of this site as NSA specific. I hope we can grow it into a thriving platform for substantive technical discussion.</p>
<p>One approach here: be brave when you feel you can; post questions/ideas in <a href="http://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu" target="_blank" title="http://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu">discourse-nsa.ucar.edu</a>.</p>
<p>I welcome your thoughts here!</p>
