<p>Here's a seminar ad from Brian Dobbins (<a href="mailto:bdobbins@ucar.edu">bdobbins@ucar.edu</a>), note that it is <strong>today</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given how ChatGPT is a frequent topic of conversation, and a number of people in CGD have used it to help with programming questions, I wanted to extend an invite to tomorrow's 2pm CSEG meeting to anyone interested.  We'll be remotely hosting Anthony Zhou, an undergraduate with LEAP who worked on a project this summer that looked at using ChatGPT to convert code in the land model's photosynthesis module to Python + JAX.  The main questions he was examining were, a) is this useful, and b) how much easier is it when using these kinds of AI tools?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The details are below; feel free to share with others who might be interested.  Additionally, these 'guest talks' are something we're aiming to do every month or so; if you wish to be included to them regularly, just let me know and I'll create a 'cseg-guest-talks' alias for that.</p>
