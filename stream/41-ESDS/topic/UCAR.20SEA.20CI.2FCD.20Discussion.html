<p>The <a href="https://sea.ucar.edu/">UCAR Software Engineering Assembly</a> is hosting a virtual discussion on CI/CD tomorrow (info below).  Might be of interest to some folks in this community as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to Drew for the reminder to share!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly for a lightly-moderated discussion on continuous integration / continuous development (CI/CD) across UCAR. We encourage those of you who are already employing CI/CD pipelines in your work to share your strategies, approaches, and best practices for managing your workflows. Have you found a particular CI platform to be the easiest to use or most powerful? Are you interested in using self-hosted runners to augment your pipelines with additional or atypical compute hardware? Do you have questions on how to keep your pipelines secure when driven from public source code repositories? Any discussion topics are welcome, as are all experience levels.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=MzZ0am00cDVnaG5oN3VmNXBiMDZjODI2dTYgdmFuZGVyd2JAdWNhci5lZHU&amp;tmsrc=vanderwb%40ucar.edu">virtually at 10 AM on Tuesday October 24th</a>. So join us for the discussion and make connections with others doing CI/CD across the lab!</p>
