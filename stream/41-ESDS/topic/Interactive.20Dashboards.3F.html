<p>Hi all. At some event, or forum, someone gave a presentation on web-based or interactive dashboards. Does anyone have any information about that? I can't seem to recall or locate any details about what I am searching for.</p>

<p>Nick Cote may have mentioned these in his January 8th ESDS Forum on the on-prem cloud effort.  Notes here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lpcxSWmcdeguchuGxmAG895w1HMQRexCGIxjxDZ8YQ/edit#heading=h.3a90k73budbe">https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lpcxSWmcdeguchuGxmAG895w1HMQRexCGIxjxDZ8YQ/edit#heading=h.3a90k73budbe</a></p>
<p>Negin Sobhani has also presented some on her work with dashboards (a current iteration of this is sometimes presented w/ the on-prem cloud stuff as well).  The talk I'm thinking about was during the CISL WIP talks series though.</p>

<p>FYI I've had some discussions about Nick (and hopefully Negin) running an ESDS sponsored workshop on dashboards using CISL's on-prem cloud</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="234">@Daniel Adriaansen</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19">@John Clyne</span> I would be happy to give a presentation on interactive dashboards. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="234">@Daniel Adriaansen</span> , Our recent CISL WIP talk had a short section on interactive visualization (so if it is recent, it is that), but I also led an ESDS discussion session on interactive visualization at ESDS annual event in 2023 and gave a presentation about this at ESDS in 2022 or 2023. I would be happy to help if there are anything in particular you are looking for.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="71">@Negin Sobhani</span> I've asked <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="342">@Nick Cote</span>  to organize a workshop/tutorial on creating interactive dashboards and suggested that he reach out to you. Nick is going to attend the April 8 ESDS committee meeting to discuss. Having an ESDS forum talk on dashboards might be a great way to drum up interest for the tutorial...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="71">@Negin Sobhani</span> I have been looking for a notebook to use as a base for a workshop where we would go from an interactive visualization in a notebook, to running with just Python, and then putting that in a container and running that. I have some ideas from Pythia cookbooks, but haven't sat down to walk through the process to test functionality for a workshop. We do have a ticket in the backlog for Notebook viz to container example.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="71">@Negin Sobhani</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="342">@Nick Cote</span>! Negin, I will revisit the 2023 ESDS Annual Event materials and see if I have other questions. You are also welcome to join us at the 08 April ESDS Committee Meeting (let me know if you need meeting details). Nick, looking forward to the discussion next Monday! I think a dashboard forum talk and possibly a workshop would be a great idea. Thanks for facilitating <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19">@John Clyne</span></p>
