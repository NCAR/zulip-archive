<p>Hi ESDS, Nick Wehrheim and Ken Cote are working on creating a BinderHub/JupyterHub NCAR cloud service. Could you help me help them develop the best product for our user base by telling me your:</p>
<ul>
<li>favorite features from the JupyterHub on Cheyenne and Casper</li>
<li>any example workflows that show data access, worker distribution, analysis, plotting (any steps I didn't touch?)</li>
<li>and of course your headaches that you've encountered (making sure your session has ended, difficulty managing environments, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your help! I will take your responses and discuss them with the team on Friday.</p>
