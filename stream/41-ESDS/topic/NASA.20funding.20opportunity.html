<p>Funding Opportunity - NASA's Open Source Science Initiative (OSSI) welcomes proposals relevant to its goals to expand open science for the Science Mission Directorate. See section 3.6.1 at this <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bC669B5EF-ACBB-A0E4-B57D-06F31DEABDB5%7d&amp;path=&amp;method=init">link</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Source Science Initiative (OSSI) welcomes proposals relevant to its goals to<br>
expand open science for the Science Mission Directorate. This includes events that<br>
support the vision of enabling transformation open science through the continuous<br>
evolution of science data and computing as outlined in SMD's Strategy for Data<br>
Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024. The goals of the<br>
OSSI include development and implementation of capabilities to enable open science,<br>
continuous evolution of data and computer systems, and harnessing the scientific<br>
community and strategic partnerships for innovation. Events designed to expand the<br>
open science capabilities of the SMD scientific community are welcome including:<br>
• Events focused on SMD data, software, or open science practices<br>
• Hackathons, un-conferences, and challenges that build open science skills<br>
• Training in open science<br>
Proposals that include training should align to and address the Transform to Open<br>
Science (TOPS) initiative. In addition to relevance to OSSI, the proposal must also<br>
include how the material produced as part of the event will be made openly available<br>
and plans for inclusive participation in the event.</p>
