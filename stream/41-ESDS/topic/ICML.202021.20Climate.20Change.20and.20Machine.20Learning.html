<p>Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning<br>
Workshop at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2021)<br>
Virtual: July 23rd or 24th, 2021</p>
<p>Workshop website: <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/icml2021.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/icml2021.html">https://www.climatechange.ai/events/icml2021.html</a><br>
Submission deadline: May 31st<br>
Mentorship application deadline:  April 28th<br>
Contact: <a href="mailto:climatechangeai.icml2021@gmail.com" title="mailto:climatechangeai.icml2021@gmail.com">climatechangeai.icml2021@gmail.com</a><br>
Informational webinars: April 23 (1:30 PM ET) and April 27 (9 AM ET)</p>
<p>We invite submissions of short papers using machine learning to address climate change. All machine learning techniques are welcome, from kernel methods to deep learning. Each submission should clearly illustrate why the application has (or could have) a pathway to impact regarding climate change. We highly encourage submissions that make their data publicly available. <br>
Submissions are non-archival, and do not preclude future publication.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage authors to consider applying for our mentorship program (applications due April 28th), which will pair authors with mentors having complementary expertise. Applications to participate as a mentor are also open; we invite those from academia, industry, government, and beyond to apply. Please see the workshop website for application instructions and more details on the program. </p>
