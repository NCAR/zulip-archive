<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>The <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr">National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR)</a> is set to revolutionize AI research accessibility in the United States. A key part of this vision is the NAIRR Portal, a central hub connecting researchers, educators, and students with crucial AI resources. We're excited to invite you to participate in a survey that will directly shape the design and development of this transformative platform.</p>
<p>Your input is invaluable in ensuring that the NAIRR Portal meets the diverse needs of our AI community and empowers researchers from all backgrounds to innovate and address critical societal challenges. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes, and all responses will be anonymized and reported in aggregate to NSF.</p>
