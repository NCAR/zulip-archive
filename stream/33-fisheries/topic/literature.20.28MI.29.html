<p><strong>Climate-driven aerobic habitat loss in the California Current System</strong><br>
Climate warming is expected to intensify hypoxia in the California Current System (CCS), threatening its diverse<br>
and productive marine ecosystem. We analyzed past regional variability and future changes in the Metabolic<br>
Index (Φ), a species-specific measure of the environment’s capacity to meet temperature-dependent organismal<br>
oxygen demand. Across the traits of diverse animals, Φ exhibits strong seasonal to interdecadal variations<br>
throughout the CCS, implying that resident species already experience large fluctuations in available aerobic habitat. For a key CCS species, northern anchovy, the long-term biogeographic distribution and decadal fluctuations in abundance are both highly coherent with aerobic habitat volume. Ocean warming and oxygen loss by 2100 are<br>
projected to decrease Φ below critical levels in 30 to 50% of anchovies’ present range, including complete loss of<br>
aerobic habitat—and thus likely extirpation—from the southern CCS. Aerobic habitat loss will vary widely across<br>
the traits of CCS taxa, disrupting ecological interactions throughout the region.</p>
