<p>Hi all!<br>
The GPU Workshop as offered with support from CISL and the CSG + ASAP teams will finish out our remaining sessions teaching GPU Computing with Python. This is a shift away from the compiled languages we were focusing on in the first part of the series. New participants are always welcome and you are not required to have attended previous sessions.</p>
<p>The upcoming session, <strong>"GPU Python with CuPy and Legate"</strong>, on July 28 will cover CuPy and NVIDIA's cuNumeric/Legate options for drop-in replacement of NumPy and SciPy routines as well as other related topics, such as running a CFD Python code on GPUs. Please be on the lookout for upcoming messages from the DailyB to sign up or check out the <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/what-we-do/training-library/gpu-computing-workshops">GPU Workshop series website</a> to sign up prior to July 22. If you can't attend live, all material will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/NCAR/GPU_workshop">github.com/NCAR/GPU_Workshop</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you have any current workflows that utilize GPUs within the Python ecosystem which we may not already be aware of, please let me know and we may be able to plug your work within these upcoming sessions. This includes AI/ML tasks.</p>
<p>Thanks and looking forward to seeing you online next week!</p>
