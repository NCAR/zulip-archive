<p>With all of the great work being done with Python here, I wanted to post that our AMS Symposium on Advances in Modeling and Analysis Using Python is soliciting abstract now through September 1st.  </p>
<p><a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2022/program-events/conferences-and-symposia/12th-symposium-on-advances-in-modeling-and-analysis-using-python/" target="_blank" title="https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2022/program-events/conferences-and-symposia/12th-symposium-on-advances-in-modeling-and-analysis-using-python/">https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2022/program-events/conferences-and-symposia/12th-symposium-on-advances-in-modeling-and-analysis-using-python/</a></p>
<p>We're soliciting abstract on the following:<br>
New Python Tools in the Atmospheric and Oceanographic Sciences;<br>
Python in Operations and Research to Operations;<br>
Teaching, Training, Outreach, and Building Communities around Python;<br>
 Visualization and Data Discovery Using Python;<br>
Visualization and Data Discovery Using Python;<br>
 Working with Large Datasets Using Python.</p>
<p>And we have joint sessions with these other Conferences and Symposia:<br>
Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Predictability (AI4ESP): How do we affect a paradigm shift in earth system modeling using AI;<br>
Cloud Computing for Big Data in Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate (Joint between the 38th Conference on Environmental Information Processing Technologies and the 12th Symposium on Advances in Modeling and Analysis Using Python);<br>
Developing Cloud-based Tools for Data Analysis and Archiving (Joint between the 38th Conference on Environmental Information Processing Technologies and the 12th Symposium on Advances in Modeling and Analysis Using Python);<br>
FAIR and Open Data and Software within the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences to Support Replicable R (Joint between the 38th Conference on Environmental Information Processing Technologies and the 12th Symposium on Advances in Modeling and Analysis Using Python).</p>
<p>The conference will be held in person and virtually (presenters are allowed to present virtually) and will be held January 23-27.</p>
