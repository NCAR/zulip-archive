<p>Hellooo! When I look at glade quota in terminal it shows I am 99.98% full in <code>/glade/u/home/olivarez</code> but when I navigate to the folder I cannot see any of the 247,878 files it says I have. Can someone teach me how to access and delete whatever it is that I've done? </p>
<p>Secondly, I have been working in <code>/glade/work/olivarez</code> for many months and recently discovered I was at capacity there as well. I've been backing up files and deleting them but I continue to receive disk I/O errors when attempting to save open notebooks or even attempting to load a library into an environment. My question is if I can empty <code>/glade/u/home/olivarez</code> will this solve the problem? Currently my work folder is at 62.51%.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any tips and tricks you can share!</p>

<p>Following up that I got help from the Help Desk and learned the environment I use daily was configured in my home directory rather than my work directory. I cloned it into my work directory, deleted the one in the home directory, and now all is well.</p>
