<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Hello Colleagues,</p>
<p>Please consider submitting your work to our session on FAIR and Open<br>
Data and Software within the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences to Support<br>
Transparent, Reusable and Efficient Research at the January 2023 AMS<br>
Annual Meeting! Abstracts are due Aug 24.</p>
<p><a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/103ANNUAL/webprogrampreliminary/Session62154.html">https://ams.confex.com/ams/103ANNUAL/webprogrampreliminary/Session62154.html</a></p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The need to understand linkages between climatic extremes and security<br>
outcomes such as displacement/migration, public health, and<br>
food/electricity production has never been higher. Analysis of these<br>
linkages requires integration of the Earth, social, economic, and<br>
political sciences as well as equitable access to community datasets,<br>
data proximate compute, community developed data analysis workflows<br>
and open source software tools. In this session, we invite submissions<br>
that discuss research, applications and initiatives that build upon<br>
the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and<br>
Reusable) Open Data and Software within the atmospheric and related<br>
sciences to drive new discoveries. We welcome technical, policy, and<br>
community-focused submissions on a range of topics related to<br>
facilitating transparency of science and leveraging community<br>
supported open science capabilities to drive research and operational<br>
outcomes. Examples include:</p>
<p>1.Research, operations and industry uses that employ a combination of<br>
public cloud compute, cloud hosted datasets such as those provided<br>
through NOAA’s Open Data Dissemination Program, and open source data<br>
analysis tools and workflows.<br>
2.Solutions for data and software discoverability, metadata creation<br>
and management, provenance tracking, and other relevant topics.</p>
<p>Platforms for reproducible research and reusable tools will accelerate<br>
the analytics enterprise and build the salience, credibility, and<br>
legitimacy required to effectively inform policy. This session will<br>
highlight emerging open-science tools and platforms for weather and<br>
climate-security analysis.</p>
