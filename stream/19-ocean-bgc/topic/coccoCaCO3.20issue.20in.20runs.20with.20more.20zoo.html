<p>I have been puzzling about issue with coccoCaCO3 that manifests only when I run with additional zooplankton groups.</p>
<p>Here are the cocco biomass fields for a run with just one zooplankton (a normal cocco run): <a href="/user_uploads/2/b4/SEDlW75o1IH8OIAMsdujlpcu/MARBL_4p1z_cocco.png" target="_blank" title="MARBL_4p1z_cocco.png">MARBL_4p1z_cocco.png</a></p>

These runs were done out of the same sandbox. I've chatted with Mike about this issue, but we can't seem to find any obvious reasons for the disconnect between coccoC and coccoCaCO3 in the runs with more zooplankton. The phytoplankton parameters in these runs are exactly the same, except for the <code>QCaCO3_max</code> is set to 1 in the 4zoo run and <code>QCaCO3_max</code> set to 2 in the 1zoo run (which is the default for an explicit calcifier). I had to make this change because, if I have <code>QCaCO3_max=2.0</code> in the 4zoo run, it crashed with an error that said something about the ballast exceeding the POC flux... </p>
<p>Also worth noting, this pattern also shows up on the CaCO3_PROD_zint variable, but globally integrated calcification is still very low for the 4p4z run.. and surface Alk still has positive bias so the excessive coccoCaCO3 in mid to low latitudes doesn't seem to be projecting onto alkalinity.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="31">@Keith Lindsay</span>  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14">@Matt Long</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10">@Michael Levy</span> , <br>
I ran a couple tests over the last couple days and think I figured out this coccoCaCO3 problem. The issue is that there is much more P-limitation in the 4 zooplankton set up. There is a well documented increase in coccolithophore PIC/POC ratios under P-limitation in lab studies. This was part of my coccolithophore parameterization, but it never really had much of an effect since there's not usually much P-limitation at all in CESM. However, when I added additional zooplankton, P limitation became much more severe. I think this is because there's more POC/POP sinking flux with more  zooplankton. it caused my parameterization to have much more of an effect (perhaps unrealistic) than I've ever seen before. </p>
<p>Here is cocco P-limitation with only one zooplankton:<br>

<p>So for tuning the 4P4Z version, should I aim to reduce P-limitation? ... or is more P-limitation ok? (just not having such an extreme effect on coccolithophore PIC/POC)?</p>

<p><strong>An iron cycle cascade governs the response of equatorial Pacific ecosystems to climate change</strong><br>
<strong>Tagliabue et al., 2020</strong><br>
Earth System Models project that global climate change will reduce ocean net pri-mary production (NPP), upper trophic level biota biomass and potential fisheries catches in the future, especially in the eastern equatorial Pacific. However, projec-tions from Earth System Models are undermined by poorly constrained assumptions regarding the biological cycling of iron, which is the main limiting resource for NPP over large parts of the ocean. In this study, we show that the climate change trends in NPP and the biomass of upper trophic levels are strongly affected by modifying assumptions associated with phytoplankton iron uptake. Using a suite of model ex-periments, we find 21st century climate change impacts on regional NPP range from −12.3% to +2.4% under a high emissions climate change scenario. This wide range arises from variations in the efficiency of iron retention in the upper ocean in the eastern equatorial Pacific across different scenarios of biological iron uptake, which affect the strength of regional iron limitation. Those scenarios where nitrogen limita-tion replaced iron limitation showed the largest projected NPP declines, while those where iron limitation was more resilient displayed little future change. All model sce-narios have similar skill in reproducing past inter-annual variations in regional ocean NPP, largely due to limited change in the historical period. Ultimately, projections of end of century upper trophic level biomass change are altered by 50%–80% across all plausible scenarios. Overall, we find that uncertainties in the biological iron cycle cas-cade through open ocean pelagic ecosystems, from plankton to fish, affecting their evolution under climate change. This highlights additional challenges to developing effective conservation and fisheries management policies under climate change.<br>

<p><strong>Optimality-based non-Redfield plankton–ecosystem model (OPEM v1.1) in UVic-ESCM 2.9 – Part 1: Implementation and model behaviour</strong><br>
<strong>Pahlow et al 2020</strong><br>
A implementation of an optimality-based plankton– ecosystem model (OPEM) version 1.1 with variable carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) stoichiometry in the University of Victoria ESM (UVic; Eby et al., 2009; Weaver et al., 2001) and the behaviour of two calibrated reference configurations, which differ in the assumed temperature de- pendence of diazotrophs. Compared to the classic fixed-stoichiometry UVic model, OPEM is closer to recent satellite-based estimates of net community production (NCP), despite overestimating net primary production (NPP), can better reproduce deep-ocean gradients in the NO− : PO3− ratio and partially explains ob- 34 served patterns of particulate C : N : P in the surface ocean. Allowing diazotrophs to grow (but not necessarily fix N2) at similar temperatures as other phytoplankton results in a bet- ter representation of surface Chl and NPP in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Deficiencies of our calibrated OPEM configurations may serve as a magnifying glass for shortcomings in global biogeochemical models and hence guide future model devel opment. <br>
