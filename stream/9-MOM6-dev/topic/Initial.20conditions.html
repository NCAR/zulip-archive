<p>Months ago we were confronting challenges with WOA interpolation issues in the Arctic. I think we developed a workaround based on smoothing?</p>
<p>I came across this Arctic-specific NODC product <br>

<p>I haven't looked at this product, so don't know if it addresses the interpolation issues. Revisiting the IC problems may not be a high priority now, but I thought I'd make a note of this in case it is useful.</p>

<p>Thanks, Matt. We ended up not applying any smoothing since the issue goes away within the first day of simulation. I will take a look at this product when we are ready to revise the initial conditions.</p>
