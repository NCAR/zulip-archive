<p>With the broad aim of developing a workflow that may eventually replace the existing diagnostics package it seems like some basic tools would be useful (e.g. the current post-processing tools that convert monthly history files to annual output).  It seems like there's opportunities to use CF conventions for unit conversions, weighting by days per month, some logic on averaging stocks vs. summing fluxes, etc that could be pretty standardized.  Maybe this is already under way, and I'm not aware of all the tools that are available.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="67">@will wieder</span> Yes. Much of this is already under way. The Xdev and GeoCAT teams are working on this.  We hope to provide an online tutorial this summer to help teach interested people like you about the existing software stack so you can help us determine the tools that are missing or how existing tools are lacking. Please stay tuned!</p>

<p>Also, most of this work is being done outside of NCAR within the Pangeo community. I highly recommend, if you have time and are motivated, to get involved in that community.  See <a href="http://pangeo.io" target="_blank" title="http://pangeo.io">http://pangeo.io</a> for more information.</p>
