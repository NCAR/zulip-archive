<p>CISL is considering submitting an NSF EarthCube proposal that would focus on providing more capable and more scalable Python tools for analyzing and visualizing unstructured grids, such as those employed by MPAS, CAM-SE, and FV3 to name a few. We're trying to identify use cases and needed capabilities in this area, and encourage users of these models to reach out. We'd like to hear about your workflow (current or future) with these data, what is working for you, and what is not working.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19">@John Clyne</span> , The AMP group in CGD has also discussed putting together a proposal that would potentially focus on improving our atmosphere model diagnostic. There would naturally be an emphasis on dealing with unstructured grids (CAM-SE, FV3, and MPAS). I wonder if it would be worthwhile to go in together on one proposal? We should loop Rich Neale into the conversation, and possibly others. Maybe a meeting in January?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="61">@Brian Medeiros</span> I'd be happy to have a zoom call in early January to discuss. Do you want to set that up with your team members? My calendar is up to date. Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, I will try to set something up within the next week or so. I will be in touch.</p>

<p>Sounds good. Thanks, Brian.</p>
