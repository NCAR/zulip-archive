<p>A group of us (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14">@Matt Long</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13">@Anderson Banihirwe</span> , and I, among others) are looking into the feasibility of having CESM generate an <code>intake-esm</code> catalog with every run. This would allow a CESM diagnostic package to rely on <code>intake-esm</code> to read data into DataSets and abstract away the need to know what data is in what file in the archive.</p>
<p>This will likely change the <code>intake-esm</code> interface quite a bit - currently, <code>open_esm_datastore()</code> expects a path to a json file as an argument; that file points to a <code>csv</code> file (that actually contains the data such as file paths and variable names) and also tells <code>intake-esm</code> how to interpret said data. We hope to standardize the information in the json file, and eventually update the <code>open_esm_datastore()</code> API such that it expects a path to the csv file and another argument such as <code>spec="cesm"</code> that replaces the need for the json file.</p>
<p>We are still in early stages of this project, and encourage any feedback, concerns, or assistance you want to offer. I suspect this will be my focus in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="21" href="/#narrow/stream/21-hack-projects">#hack-projects</a> for the next several months</p>

<p>In general, I am in favor of this.  Just be sure to keep <code>intake-esm</code> general, and not CESM-specific.  If you can encode the "cesm" <code>spec</code> in a way that makes it easier for <em>other</em> models to add their own <code>spec</code> (or, even better, make the <code>spec</code> a separate package independent of <code>intake-esm</code> or any of its other core packages...so the <code>spec</code> is a plug-in), that's ideal.</p>

<p>Today intake-esm allows instantiating  an instance of <code>esm_datastore</code> class without using a JSON file. All you have to do is pass in a data-frame (content of the CSV), and a dictionary(content of the JSON file) as follows:</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking more about this, and I grow increasingly concerned about developing technology to deal with CESM issues. In my mind, many of the problems people have with ESM data stems from non-standardization, and the “need” to make modifications to intake-ESM to accommodate CESM needs, is one of those issues. I believe that we should <em>not</em> be spending time developing solutions to make the tools work with CESM data, but spending more time making CESM data “standardized.”</p>
<p>Now, I know that most CESM developers say that CESM is standardized because it is CF compliant. But CF is not a standard. It is a set of conventions. The only thing we have close to a standard for ESM data is CMIP. So, I think we should be spending our effort getting CESM to output CMIP-compliant data. </p>

<p>We develop CESM and are in urgent need of frameworks for effective analysis. In my view, our primary objectives are to develop general tools that work with CESM.  Conventions are great, but we also need a general framework to provide work-arounds when they inevitably fall short. There is no such thing as full CMIP-compliance. We output numerous variables that aren't even defined in CMIP.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to offend. And perhaps<br>
I should not have used the word “issues” because that implies “problems”. </p>
<p>I believe the shortfalls you are referring to primarily come from not having a fully defined standard. And as you point out, CMIP is not fully defined. Rather, it is the closest thing we have. I think we should be involved in fully defining that standard. And perhaps modifications to CESM could lead the way. However, it is generally believed that property defined standards, and rigid conformance to those standards, reduces the pitfalls to which you allude. </p>
<p>Workarounds are always needed in a pinch. But I fear that the workaround becomes the practice. And it then becomes the “approved solution.” Also, workarounds should be minimal effort, and I am concerned of the level of effort being put into workarounds.</p>

<p>Having some form of standardization across the CESM components would help a lot with the catalog generation(at least).  I am not familiar with CESM run workflow, but it is my understanding that a lot of information we are having to assemble in order to build the catalog (see this <a href="https://github.com/NCAR/intake-esm-datastore/pull/70#issuecomment-631786585" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/NCAR/intake-esm-datastore/pull/70#issuecomment-631786585">comment</a> by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="37">@Sheri Mickelson</span> ) consists of attributes that may be persisted in the global attributes of the model output.</p>

<p>Yes. I believe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13">@Anderson Banihirwe</span>’s point is that we might need to work on both sides of the problem: both developing general tools that operate on standardized data and modifying the model output to better conform to those standards. </p>

<p>Intake-esm should have a relatively narrow focus, which is to bridge the gap between the vagaries of file systems and files, enabling a semantic API to getting an <code>xarray.Dataset</code> from collections of files. That's it.</p>

<p>I think a prototype to accomplish this is worth it (as a short term solution). I echo <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="8">@Kevin Paul</span>'s comments on modifying the model output to better conform to <strong>some</strong> standards as a long term solution</p>

<p>Part of me thinks that discussing whether or not we need more information in CESM history files is a little orthogonal to the goal of have the CESM workflow generate the catalog. It would definitely help in generating catalogs after the fact, but for the proposed idea of either updating the timeseries generation step in CESM postprocessing or the short term archiver, both of those tools will have access to the XML files in <code>$CASEROOT</code> that already contain the information we'd want to put in history files.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="8">@Kevin Paul</span>, the object is to get the model to write intake catalog files. By hook or by crook. I would suggest that this is a relatively autonomous tool that is called by post-processing hooks in the run infrastructure.</p>

<p>And if the goal is to distribute the catalog with the archive (and introduce a mechanism for combining catalogs for ensembles), then I think the only use for generating a catalog from CESM output will be to catalog old runs, which won't have the proposed metadata anyway.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="8">@Kevin Paul</span> Yes! Sorry if this was unclear, but the bulk of this work will be updating CESM (I think either post-processing or the archiver, which might technically be in CIME). I proposed changing the <code>intake-esm</code> interface to require a single <code>csv</code> file rather than a <code>csv</code> file AND a <code>json</code> file because I've found that I generate the same json file for every CESM catalog, except they all point to different <code>csv</code> files; that sort of redundancy led me to think that the <code>intake-esm</code> interface could be improved once everything is standardized, but I don't think I did a good job of separating that particular wishlist item from the project description as a whole</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14">@Matt Long</span> makes a good point -- my "Yes!" response is more based on a blueprint that mostly exists in my head and will likely change, but CESM will either generate the catalog itself or call an independent tool that is CESM-aware and can pull data out of the case root.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I know that most CESM developers say that CESM is standardized because it is CF compliant. But CF is not a standard. It is a set of conventions. The only thing we have close to a standard for ESM data is CMIP. So, I think we should be spending our effort getting CESM to output CMIP-compliant data. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the Earth science community uses and is familiar with the CF Conventions, whereas only CMIP people are familiar with the CMIP conventions, so I would argue that CF is "more standard." As far as I know, neither has been officially adopted by a standards-developing organization, although CF-NetCDF3 was adopted by the Open Geospatial Consortium in ~2010 (thanks to the work of Ben Domenico at Unidata).</p>
<p>I am curious which aspects of CESM should be made more standard, and whether some aspects are covered only by CF or only by CMIP, or are covered by both in a contradictory fashion.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it unfortunate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The variable names are different in CESM/CMIP and CESM/LENS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CF Standard Names are buried in the metadata rather than exposed at the file/object level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In LENS, there are a number of gratuitous incompatibilities requiring a human, e.g.:</p>
</li>
<li>Some fields have different short names depending on whether monthly or daily (e.g., aice vs aice_d).<br>
   [I realize the ice model needs to do it this way, but it could have been fixed in post-processing.]</li>
<li>Some fields have different short names but the same long name (e.g., SST, TEMP = Potential Temperature).<br>
   [I realize SST = TEMP @ surface, but still this is bad practice.]</li>
<li>Some fields are the same but express the units differently (e.g., atmos TAUX  is N/m2, but land TAUX is in kg/m/s^2).<br>
   [I realize 1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2]</li>
<li>Squared units are expressed as s2 or m2 at some times, and s^2 or m^2 at others.</li>
<li>TAUX2 is wind stress squared for ocean monthly, but TAUX_2 is wind stress (not squared) for ocean daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least some of these things can be made more standard at the Intake-ESM level, as I will demonstrate on Wed Mar 27 at 09:00 MDT.</p>

Regarding fields having different short names but the same long name, it's not clear what behavior you would like to see.<br>
Do you want 1) different long names, or 2) same short names? I see pro and cons to either alternative.</p>
