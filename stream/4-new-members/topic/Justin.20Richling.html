<p>Hi team, I just found out about this group and wanted to introduce myself to those I haven't met yet! I recently joined AMP as an ASII working towards our new CAM diagnostics package, ADF, which is being built in Python so this seems like a great resource for us. I come from COMET where I was a casual so I've been in the UCAR family for about 4 years now. I have an extensive Python background, so I hope to pull my weight in answering questions as much as asking them.</p>
