<p>I haven't yet - looking back at my notes, I think I was aiming to have a year done by mid-February and even created a case (<code>/glade/work/mlevy/hi-res_BGC_JRA/cases/g.e22.G1850ECOIAF_JRA_HR.TL319_g17.004_companion</code>), but haven't run <code>case.setup</code> yet let alone tried to figure out comparable initial condition files and namelist settings</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10">@Michael Levy</span>. I think this could actually be really helpful for some of the analysis <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="28">@Kristen Krumhardt</span> is working on. If the majority of the set up task are already done, it could be worth kicking off the run. Kristen is working on an analysis for a project meeting 14 Dec and I could see this being helpful in that context.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14">@Matt Long</span> Kristen, Keith, and I just met and I think the companion run will require a little more work than I naively expected, but we should be able to get it up and running soon. I have a few questions about getting it all set up, though.</p>
<p>First off, the high-res run was a hybrid case that used physics from a run Alper did. He had run 4 61-year JRA cycles, and I don't think there is a comparable one-degree case... so as a first step I was going to run a 4-cycle case (without BGC). Some questions about that run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should we stick with the 61-year JRA cycles (which matches what our high-res run used), or switch to 63-year cycles?</li>
<li>The high-res runs use a stub wave model instead of WW3 - should we turn off the wave model in the 1 degree run?</li>
<li>The high-res runs use CICE4 instead of CICE5 - which version of CICE should we use in the 1 degree run?</li>
<li>The high-res run does not use the estuary box model (or the EBM is configured to be "partially on", as I think Keith phrased it) -- should we mimic those settings in the 1 degree run, or use the out-of-the-box EBM settings?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also three CICE namelist changes (<code>ndtd=2</code>, <code>r_snw=1.00</code>, <code>f_blkmask=true</code>) that I want to ask Dave B about because we aren't sure what they do, and the high res run uses a specific coupler sequence (<code>RASM_OPTION1</code>) that might actually be the 1 degree default but I need to double-check.</p>
<p>While that run is going, I still need to generate the BGC initial condition file... but I think that'll be easy since the high res run just interpolated the tracer state from Kristen's run after 2 JRA cycles - for this run, I'll use the same output but the interpolation won't be necessary.</p>
<p>Also, I promised <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="31">@Keith Lindsay</span> I would point him to <code>/glade/work/mlevy/hi-res_BGC_JRA/setup_1deg_case.sh</code>, which is the script I'll run to actually configure the companion run after the physics-only JRA cycles are complete.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10">@Michael Levy</span>.  </p>
<p>I was thinking that you'd simply continue the 1° spin-up integration that you used to generate the BGC initial conditions for the 0.1° case. This would be an imperfect comparison case, for sure. </p>
<p>The configuration details you mention are worth consideration. I am not sure, however, whether it's worth the effort at this time. Perhaps we should hold off on this step and decide once we progress with the 0.1° analyses whether to pursue running this more complete analog case.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="20">@Fred Castruccio</span> just stopped by my desk and pointed out that there is a low-res equivalent to the high-res run we branched off of. It's in <code>/glade/campaign/collections/cmip/CMIP6/iHESP/FOSI/LR/</code>, though  you to be in the <code>ihesp</code> group to access the data and I'm not in the group yet... so it's not immediately clear to me what is in that directory.</p>
<p>I know for now we're just going to continue with Kristen's run, but Fred is working to get me access so if we do decide to set up a companion case that is more similar to the high-res run, we can take advantage of this companion spinup case existing already.</p>
